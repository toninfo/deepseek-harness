/**
 * `dsh` default surface — the interactive TUI coding agent. Boots the shipped
 * shared base and TUI overlay, followed by either `--config` or the personal overlay
 * from the Harness home (`~/.dsh`): its `.env` fills environment gaps (precedence:
 * ambient environment, then the invoking directory's `.env`, then the personal one)
 * and its `config.yaml` patches the booted tree. The workspace is the invoking
 * directory: the session cwd, relative paths, and workspace instructions resolve
 * from it, so `dsh` acts on whatever project it is launched in. Session storage
 * is the exception — it lives under the Harness home so `/resume` reaches every
 * workspace, and an in-place resume enters the selected session's own directory.
 * `dsh experimental-meta` is the one exception — it makes this harness
 * checkout the workspace. `dsh experimental-upgrade` is a fresh session whose
 * first turn auto-invokes a bundled skill. After boot, the agent's system
 * prompt is told the path to this harness checkout so it can find its own
 * source.
