# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness SDK is a plugin-based agent harness on vendored Cordis: **everything is a plugin**. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

**Remove this section at the first tagged release.** With no external consumers, prefer the correct foundation over compatibility shims: rename or repackage freely and update every reference together. Backends reject old on-disk formats. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`; `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` with no compatibility promise.

```

### Host sandbox failures

When required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator commands fail because the agent sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, file watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation before diagnosing authentication or project failure. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass genuine test failures or the product sandbox under test.

### Run relevant checks locally

Agents MUST run relevant tests and checks before pushing; select them with [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md) and report only commands run.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused tests for behavior, snapshots for model or user output, `doc-sync` for docs, build/hygiene and built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for provider behavior.
- Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push. CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; rehearse all locally only by explicit request, for CI diagnosis, or for an irreducibly repository-wide change.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) only under plugin `config`; Loader metadata is static, so conditional composition uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages keep upstream names and are `private: true`. `cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`). Cross-package imports use package names; in-package relative imports include `.ts`. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch runs through tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`); modules it reaches must stay ESM (no CJS-only shapes) — Node's native TypeScript modes are unavailable across the engines range ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). TUI/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Check authoritative event streams or mutable data, not service or method presence, plugin metadata or effects, or fixed pure examples. If a package has no plausible relationship, an explained empty companion is correct ([package contract](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns.
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it is the veto ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on the documented extension seams; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **Capability seams are three packages** — interface / implementation / consumer; don't split preemptively.
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package seams**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-bash` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test seam is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process seams.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** Each package uses one aggregate except `api/remotes`; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** only mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-user-visible behavior change adds or updates a keyless snapshot through a real runnable example in the same PR; package tests, e2e-only assertions, and mock-only fixtures do not substitute for the assembled application transcript. Fixtures must replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **A tool's UI render intent is part of its design**, decided up front (`generic`/`terminal`/`diff`, `locations`); presentation methods are pure functions of `args` ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for new seams, lifecycle shapes, and transcript surfaces; missing snapshot-harness support is part of the implementation, not deferred follow-up.
- **Use incremental merge commits.** Split independent changes. Pushed history may be rewritten before review; afterward prefer new commits. Fix the introducing PR before merging down-stack. If the base advances mid-merge, finish the checkpoint, push when authorized, then merge the newer tip separately ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-incremental-pr-base-retargeting.md)).
- **Label PRs:** one kind (`feature`/`bug-fix`/`doc`/`testing`/`cleanup`), each matching area; the [taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-25-semantic-pr-label-taxonomy.md) is extensible.
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why a narrower type is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`. Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring seam, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs preserve complete contracts and non-obvious orientation, not reasoning transcripts. Do not narrate control flow or tests, preserve review history, or restate code. Keep factual clauses affecting behavior, failure, timing, ownership, or safe use; link aggressively to owning rationale. Use [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) for prose decisions. Wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each new or changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case. Use narrow justified exceptions instead of disabling a rule globally.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README/JSDoc contracts together; update both sides of a bilingual pair and re-record it ([i18n contract](docs/i18n/README.md)). Current-state prose, one physical line per paragraph, one home per fact, and word budgets live in [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root, `packages/`, and `examples/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the contract genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
