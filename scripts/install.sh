# It clones the harness under ~/.dsh/source (the master clone at
# ~/.dsh/source/master), adds a per-install staging worktree at
# ~/.dsh/source/staging-<timestamp> on branch dsh-staging/<timestamp>, checks
# host dependencies (git, Node, pnpm) and offers to install a missing pnpm, runs
# `pnpm install`, points the stable `~/.dsh/source/current` symlink
# at that staging worktree and symlinks `dsh` onto PATH at `current/bin/dsh`,
# records your API credentials in the Harness home (`~/.dsh`) dsh reads at boot,
# builds the repository artifacts, and launches the Web UI. Keeping every
# checkout under ~/.dsh/source keeps successive
# upgrades in one place instead of scattered sibling clones, and lets staging
# worktrees share the master clone's object store. The PATH symlink resolves through
# `current`, so an upgrade repoints one stable symlink instead of relinking PATH:
# the `dsh` on PATH never moves and can never dangle.
#
# When run from inside an existing checkout (e.g. `sh scripts/install.sh` rather
# than `curl ... | sh`) it never clones and never touches that working tree;
# DSH_REF is ignored. Instead it *adopts* the checkout: `git rev-parse
# --git-common-dir` resolves the repository behind it (for a linked worktree that
# is the real clone, not the worktree), and a fresh staging worktree branched
# from the checkout's HEAD lands in the source container beside `current`. The
# container owns staging worktrees and `current`; the clone is discovered, not
# owned, so an arbitrary clone (~/src/dsh) and a managed one converge on one
# layout and stay upgradable. Adoption carries committed work only: the staging
# worktree branches from HEAD, so uncommitted changes stay in the checkout.
# Setting DSH_SOURCE to a different directory opts back into the normal
# clone/worktree path.
#
# Adopting an arbitrary clone leaves the container not self-contained: its
# staging worktrees hold an absolute gitdir pointer into that clone, so deleting
# it breaks them. `git worktree list` in that clone is the record of which
# worktrees depend on it.
#
# When run through `curl | sh` the script text arrives on stdin, so every
# prompt and the final launch read the controlling terminal (/dev/tty) directly;
# with no terminal the script prints the manual next steps instead.

# --- path helpers ---------------------------------------------------------------

# paths, so comparing one against an unresolved path disagrees whenever a symlink
# sits anywhere above the checkout — a symlinked home directory is enough, and
# macOS reaches every mktemp path that way through /var -> private/var. The
# mismatch silently misclassifies an existing managed install as a foreign clone
# and builds a second container beside the real one.
# `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute` would do this, but it needs git 2.31+.
#
# A not-yet-created directory (the container on a fresh install) has no physical
# path. Falling back here rather than at each call site keeps every caller a
# plain assignment, so no site can compare against an empty path by forgetting
# its own fallback.
