# LLM Streaming

English | [中文](llm-streaming.zh.md)

The conversation and streaming vocabulary of [`packages/llm`](../../packages/llm/README.md): the `Message`/`ContentBlock` shapes every request and durable history share, the fully-assembled model request, the raw `StreamChunk` protocol, the adapter contract every adapter must obey, and the shared assembler. The [core spine](core.md) holds and logs these values on every turn; this page declares them.

## Content blocks and messages

A conversation is `Message`s; a message is an array of typed **content blocks**. The block union derives from `ContentBlockMap`.

Source: [`packages/llm/llm/src/types.ts`](../../packages/llm/llm/src/types.ts)

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Merge-extensible content blocks keyed by `type`. New core blocks must land
 * with adapter, UI, and compaction support.
 */
interface ContentBlockMap {
  'text': TextBlock
  'reasoning': ReasoningBlock
  'tool-call': ToolCallBlock
  'tool-result': ToolResultBlock
}
```

The block interfaces (full fields in source): `TextBlock` (`text`), `ReasoningBlock` (thinking, distinct from visible text), `ToolCallBlock` (`id: CallId`, `name`, raw-JSON `arguments`), `ToolResultBlock` (`toolCallId`, nested `content: ContentBlock[]`, `isError?`). `ContentBlock = ContentBlockMap[ContentBlockType]`. The core set is limited to blocks every shipping path honors — multimodal content (images, audio, …) has no core block type; a feature that needs one adds it via the merge-extensible map together with the adapter/UI/compaction support that honors it.

Source: [`packages/llm/llm/src/message.ts`](../../packages/llm/llm/src/message.ts)

A `Message` is one identified, immutable role/source/content value. Model-produced assistant messages carry provider/model ownership and optional adapter-private replay metadata in their source:

```ts type-equiv
/** Provider ownership and adapter-private replay data for an assistant message. */
interface AssistantProvenance {
  /** Provider route that produced the message. */
  provider: string
  /** Provider model id that produced the message. */
  model: string
  /**
   * Lossless-JSON adapter state needed to replay the provider response.
   * `LlmService` exposes it to a target adapter only when that adapter instance
   * currently owns both this historical provider and the target provider.
   */
  replayState?: unknown
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One immutable message representation shared by delivery, durable history, and model requests. */
interface Message {
  /** Stable identity preserved across every representation boundary. */
  readonly id: MessageId
  /** Provider-neutral conversation role. */
  readonly role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant'
  /** Exact model-facing blocks. */
  readonly content: ContentBlock[]
  /** Required producer provenance. */
  readonly source: MessageSource
}
```

Where a message came from is itself a merge-extensible sum type:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Where a message (or injected content) came from.
 * Merge-extensible sum type — plugins add their own `kind`s.
 */
interface MessageSourceMap {
  user: { kind: 'user' }
  plugin: { kind: 'plugin'; plugin: string }
  model: ModelMessageSource
  tool: ToolMessageSource
}
```

## `StreamChunk` — the raw protocol

A streaming response interleaves several typed blocks (text, reasoning, multiple tool calls). `index` ties each delta to its block; `block-end` carries the fully-assembled `ContentBlock` so consumers don't have to re-assemble deltas themselves. It is a **closed** discriminated union — a `switch` over `type` ends with `assertNever`, so adding a variant breaks compilation at every consumer that must handle it.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Raw streaming protocol emitted by adapters.
 * Block indexes correlate interleaved deltas, and `block-end` carries the
 * assembled block. Adapters emit usage before the terminal finish and nothing
 * afterward; tool arguments remain raw JSON strings. Failures either throw or
 * end with `error`/`aborted`, and consumers must handle both paths.
 */
type StreamChunk =
  | { type: 'block-start'; index: number; blockType: ContentBlockType }
  | { type: 'text-delta'; index: number; text: string }
  | { type: 'reasoning-delta'; index: number; text: string }
  | { type: 'tool-call-delta'; index: number; id: CallId; name?: string; argumentsDelta: string }
  | { type: 'block-end'; index: number; block: ContentBlock }
  | { type: 'usage'; usage: TokenUsage }
  | {
    type: 'finish'
    reason: FinishReason
    /** Adapter-private lossless-JSON state for replaying a successful response. */
    replayState?: unknown
  }
```

## `LlmFailure`

Every thrown or in-band final-adapter failure normalizes to one serializable provider-neutral payload. `providerRetryAfterMs` is a validated positive delay requested by the provider, not a retry decision; `ProviderRequestId` is an opaque branded string for diagnostics.

```ts type-equiv
/** Serializable provider-boundary facts; policy decides whether they are retryable. */
interface LlmFailure {
  /** Human-readable provider or transport failure. */
  readonly message: string
  /** Stable provider-neutral machine-routing code. */
  readonly code: string
  /** HTTP status observed at the provider boundary, when available. */
  readonly status?: number
  /** Provider-requested delay in milliseconds, when valid and available. */
  readonly providerRetryAfterMs?: number
  /** Opaque provider-issued request identifier for diagnostics. */
  readonly requestId?: ProviderRequestId
}
```

## The adapter contract

Every adapter MUST obey these, and every consumer may rely on them:

- **`usage` before `finish`, nothing after `finish`.** Defer both to the provider's end-of-stream marker so a trailing usage-only chunk can't violate the ordering.
- **Tool-call `arguments` stay raw JSON strings end-to-end.** Partial fragments stream via `argumentsDelta`; a provider that hands back parsed objects re-stringifies at `block-end`.
- **Two sanctioned error paths, one fact shape.** A failure may either THROW from `stream()` (transport/protocol errors) **or** end the stream with `finish {kind:'error'|'aborted', failure}` (provider in-band errors, for adapters that can't throw mid-stream). `LlmError.failure` carries the same `LlmFailure`. The final adapter boundary preserves the exact thrown `Error` object and associates immutable facts plus the serving registration's immutable retry policy with that call; the agent loop closes the failed step and offers the error, facts, immutable prior-retried facts, serving policy, and turn signal to `agent/request-error`. A handling listener returns `{ kind: 'retry' }` after its awaited repair; absent recovery the structured failure becomes the turn error, and no normal assistant message or tool side effect is committed for that attempt.
- **One adapter call is one provider attempt.** Adapters disable library retries. Agent-level recovery opens another durable numbered turn; direct `ctx.llm.stream()` callers remain single-attempt.
- **Provider stalls are bounded at the transport.** Both shipping remote adapters expose positive finite `streamIdleTimeoutMs` with a five-minute default. The watchdog arms only while iterator `next()` is outstanding, uses one stable signal for the whole request, maps its own expiry to `TIMEOUT`, and keeps an earlier caller abort as `ABORTED`.
- **Context overflow has one canonical code.** Both DeepSeek adapters classify explicit provider detail through `isContextWindowExceededError()` and surface `CONTEXT_WINDOW_EXCEEDED`, whether the failure arrives as a thrown HTTP `LlmError` or an in-band finish error. Consumers route on the code, never provider text.
- **An empty completion is a retryable error, not a silent success.** Both adapters map a terminal `stop` finish that carried no content blocks to `finish {kind:'error'}` with the canonical `EMPTY_RESPONSE` code, and `dsh-llm-retry` retries it by default; see [empty model responses are retryable](../../.agents/notes/implemented/bug-fix/2026-07-24-empty-model-response-is-retryable.md).
- **Every provider HTTP request carries the app-attribution header.** Adapters send `attributionHeaders()` (below) - the `User-Agent` baseline - and prove it with a wire-level test (mock server asserting the received header, or the library's header hook for a library-backed adapter).
- **Replay state is adapter-owned.** A successful `finish` may carry lossless-JSON state needed to reconstruct a native provider response. The loop stores it with the assembled assistant message. On a later request, `LlmService` passes the state only when the historical provider and target provider are currently registered to the exact same adapter instance. That adapter validates the state and owns any cross-model or cross-provider conversion; other adapters receive the provider-neutral content and provenance without the private state.

This contract is pinned down by two deliberately independent implementations: `dsh-llm-deepseek` (direct fetch, SSE framing via `eventsource-parser`) and `dsh-llm-pi-ai` (a generic multi-provider adapter through `@earendil-works/pi-ai`). The library-backed adapter exercises the finish-chunk error path, while transport-boundary tests prove each idle watchdog stops its actual request.

## `ResolvedRetryPolicy`

Provider configuration resolves before route registration into an immutable discriminated union. Normal mode carries `mode: 'normal'`, finite `maxRetries`, `retryableCodes`, and required `initialDelayMs`, `maxDelayMs`, and `jitterRatio`; always mode carries `mode: 'always'` and the same required backoff fields without a finite maximum. `LlmService.providerRetryPolicy(provider)` returns the currently registered value and supplies normal defaults when the adapter omits one; `llmRetryPolicyOf(stream)` returns the exact serving registration's captured value after that call enters its final adapter boundary, so later route disposal or replacement cannot change an in-flight failure's recovery policy. The [generated config catalog](../config-catalog.md) owns the optional input shapes.

## `AppIdentity` — app attribution

The static public application identity every adapter sends to providers ([`packages/llm/llm/src/attribution.ts`](../../packages/llm/llm/src/attribution.ts)). `attributionHeaders(identity?)` maps it to the standard `User-Agent` header only; OpenRouter-specific app attribution headers are intentionally not supported by this contract. The default `APP_IDENTITY` sources its version from the package manifest; every field is a public product fact - no secrets, paths, session ids, or per-user identifiers, and nothing per-request may influence the values. Rationale: [Mandatory `User-Agent` attribution](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-21-mandatory-app-attribution-headers.md).

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Static public application identity sent to LLM providers.
 *
 * Every field is a public product fact, safe on every request: no secrets,
 * local paths, session ids, prompt text, or per-user identifiers belong here,
 * and nothing per-request may influence the values.
 */
interface AppIdentity {
  /** `User-Agent` product token (lowercase, hyphenated). */
  product: string
  /** Product version; sourced from package metadata, never hand-copied. */
  version: string
  /** Public home URL of the app, used as the `User-Agent` comment. */
  url: string
}
```

## `TokenUsage`

Per-call token accounting. Counts are **disjoint**: `inputTokens` is uncached input only; cached input is reported separately, and billed input is the sum of the three. Adapters whose providers fold cache hits into a single prompt total (DeepSeek's `prompt_tokens`) subtract them back out. `reasoningTokens`, when present, is informational detail already included in `outputTokens`; totals must not add it again.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Token accounting for one model call (cache fields are optional).
 *
 * Counts are DISJOINT: `inputTokens` is uncached input only; cached input is
 * reported separately as `cacheReadTokens`/`cacheWriteTokens` (billed input =
 * sum of the three). Adapters whose providers fold cache hits into a total
 * prompt count (DeepSeek's `prompt_tokens`) subtract them out.
 */
interface TokenUsage {
  inputTokens: number
  outputTokens: number
  cacheReadTokens?: number
  cacheWriteTokens?: number
  reasoningTokens?: number
}
```

## `BlockAssembler`

`BlockAssembler` ([`packages/llm/llm/src/assembler.ts`](../../packages/llm/llm/src/assembler.ts)) is the single shared implementation that folds a `StreamChunk` stream back into `ContentBlock`s, usage, finish reason, and replay state. The loop logs the raw chunks while feeding the same chunks through an assembler, then stores the assembled assistant content with its provider/model provenance. A consumer that needs the assembled result without re-implementing the fold uses this.

```ts public-api
/**
 * Incrementally assembles raw {@link StreamChunk}s into complete
 * {@link ContentBlock}s and a final assistant {@link Message}.
 *
 * The agent loop feeds it while logging raw chunks for replay fidelity, then
 * reads `blocks()` / `message()` / `usage` / `finish` once the stream ends.
 *
 * Tolerant of delta-only protocols (no block-start/end); deltas arriving for
 * an index already closed by `block-end` are ignored (malformed stream) so a
 * misbehaving adapter cannot grow memory or corrupt a completed block.
 */
declare class BlockAssembler {
  /**
   * Feed one chunk into the assembly state.
   * @param chunk - the next raw chunk, in stream order.
   */
  push(chunk: StreamChunk): void;
  /**
   * Assemble all blocks seen so far, in stream order.
   * @returns one block per seen index; an open block assembles from its
   *   accumulated deltas (an unknown block type never closed by `block-end` throws).
   */
  blocks(): ContentBlock[];
  /** Usage from the `usage` chunk; undefined until one arrives. */
  get usage(): TokenUsage | undefined;
  /** Finish reason from the `finish` chunk; `{kind: 'stop'}` when the stream ended without one. */
  get finish(): FinishReason;
  /** Adapter-private replay state from the terminal finish chunk, if any. */
  get replayState(): unknown;
  /**
   * The assembled assistant message.
   * @param source - producer attribution for the assembled message.
   * @returns a frozen assistant-role message over `blocks()` (same open-block assembly rules).
   */
  message(source: MessageSource = { kind: 'plugin', plugin: 'dsh-llm/assembler' }): Message;
}
```

## The model request

One model call is a fully-assembled `GenerateOptions`. The adapter answers with a raw [`StreamChunk`](#streamchunk--the-raw-protocol) stream; the consumer assembles it with [`BlockAssembler`](#blockassembler).

Source: [`packages/llm/llm/src/types.ts`](../../packages/llm/llm/src/types.ts)

Provider and model discovery uses small provider-neutral descriptors. A model catalog is advisory: routing still keys on a registered provider, and an adapter may accept unlisted model ids.

Registering an adapter returns a handle: the disposer, plus the atomic route replacement a plugin whose route set is user-configurable needs.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * What {@link LlmService.registerAdapter} returns: the disposer, plus an
 * atomic route replacement for the same adapter instance.
 */
interface AdapterRegistrationHandle {
  /** Release every route this registration currently holds. */
  (): void
  /**
   * Replace this registration's routes with `providers`, keeping the same
   * adapter instance. The candidate set is validated in full first — a
   * conflict with another adapter, an invalid name, or bad provider metadata
   * throws and leaves the current routes untouched — and the swap itself is
   * one synchronous section, so no request can observe a gap. An empty array
   * is legal here (a settings section that emptied holds zero routes while
   * staying registered), unlike an empty initial registration.
   *
   * Throws `LlmError` with code `REGISTRATION_DISPOSED` once the registration
   * has been released: its routes are gone and its disposer has already run,
   * so anything registered afterwards would have no owner left to release it.
   * @param providers - the complete next route set for this registration.
   */
  replace(providers: string[]): void
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Display metadata for one registered provider route. */
interface LlmProviderInfo {
  /** Provider route key used by {@link GenerateOptions.provider}. */
  id: string
  /** Human-readable provider name for selectors and diagnostics. */
  name: string
}
```

Adapter plugins additionally declare which routes *could* run through `registerConfigurableProviders()`, addressing each one's user-settings section, so configuration surfaces can offer dormant providers before any route registers.

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * One provider route an adapter plugin can activate through configuration,
 * whether or not the route is currently registered. Configuration surfaces
 * merge this directory with `listProviders()` to offer every configurable
 * provider alongside its live/dormant state.
 */
interface LlmConfigurableProvider {
  /** Provider route key this entry activates when configured. */
  provider: string
  /** Human-readable provider name for configuration surfaces. */
  displayName: string
  /** User-settings namespace whose section configures this provider. */
  settingsNs: string
  /**
   * Path from that namespace's section root to this provider's profile
   * object; empty when the whole section is the profile.
   */
  settingsPath: readonly string[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One adapter-discovered model; catalog membership is advisory, not request validation. */
interface LlmModelInfo {
  /** Provider route that owns this model entry. */
  provider: string
  /** Model id passed to {@link GenerateOptions.model}. */
  id: string
  /** Human-readable model name for selectors. */
  name: string
  /** Optional user-facing distinction from otherwise similar models. */
  description?: string
}
```

Correctness-sensitive metadata is resolved separately from the advisory catalog and is owned by the adapter serving the exact route. Context capacity, adapter call defaults, and reasoning choices share one exact-model result so consumers do not repeat authoritative model resolution.

```ts type-equiv
/** Provider-owned context capacity for one exact provider/model route. */
interface LlmModelContext {
  /** Maximum combined request and response context in tokens. */
  contextWindow: number
}
```

Reasoning effort is another exact-route capability. The core brands identifiers but does not enumerate their values; each adapter owns the ordered set, display names, and optional deployment default.

```ts type-equiv
/** Adapter-owned identifier for one model's selectable reasoning effort. */
type ReasoningEffortId = Branded<'ReasoningEffortId'>
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Display metadata for one adapter-owned reasoning effort. */
interface LlmReasoningEffortInfo {
  /** Opaque stable value accepted by {@link GenerateOptions.reasoningEffort}. */
  id: ReasoningEffortId
  /** Human-readable effort name for selectors and diagnostics. */
  name: string
  /** Optional user-facing distinction from otherwise similar efforts. */
  description?: string
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Selectable reasoning efforts for one exact provider/model route. */
interface LlmModelReasoningInfo {
  /** Supported efforts in adapter-preferred display order. */
  efforts: readonly LlmReasoningEffortInfo[]
  /**
   * Adapter-configured default materialized into requests when callers omit
   * an effort. Absence preserves the provider's own default.
   */
  defaultEffort?: ReasoningEffortId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Exact-route model metadata resolved by its owning adapter. */
interface LlmResolvedModelInfo extends LlmModelInfo {
  /** Provider-owned context capacity when known. */
  context?: LlmModelContext
  /** Adapter-configured per-request output cap materialized when callers omit one. */
  defaultMaxTokens?: number
  /** Adapter-owned selectable reasoning levels when exposed. */
  reasoning?: LlmModelReasoningInfo
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** A single model request, fully assembled. */
interface GenerateOptions {
  /** Registered provider route selecting the adapter instance. */
  provider: string
  model: string
  /** Adapter-owned reasoning effort selected for this exact model. */
  reasoningEffort?: ReasoningEffortId
  /**
   * Ordered conversation messages, exactly as the provider sees them (after
   * the `system` slot). A loop-built request assembles them as
   * the derived history (dsh-agent-loop); a hand-built one-shot passes any list.
   */
  messages: Message[]
  /** System prompt text (adapters map to the provider's system slot). */
  system?: string
  /** Tool schemas (adapters map to the provider's `tools` field). */
  tools?: ToolSchema[]
  temperature?: number
  maxTokens?: number
  /**
   * Stop sequences: generation halts as soon as the model produces any one of
   * these strings (adapters map to the provider's stop field, e.g. OpenAI
   * `stop`). The stop string itself is not included in the output.
   */
  stop?: string[]
  signal?: AbortSignal
  /**
   * Session identity stamped by the loop for listener routing. Adapters ignore
   * it; replay uses it to keep concurrent parent and child cursors independent.
   */
  sessionId?: Branded<'SessionId'>
  /**
   * Provider-neutral classification for an auxiliary model call. Adapters may
   * map the purpose to model-hidden transport metadata or purpose-specific
   * generation policy. Ordinary conversation requests leave it unset.
   */
  purpose?: 'compaction' | 'session-title'
}
```

Why a model response stopped is a merge-extensible reason. Terminal provider failures carry the streaming contract's [`LlmFailure`](#llmfailure):

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Why a model response stopped.
 * Merge-extensible so adapters can surface provider-specific reasons.
 */
interface FinishReasonMap {
  'stop': { kind: 'stop' }
  'tool-calls': { kind: 'tool-calls' }
  'max-tokens': { kind: 'max-tokens' }
  'aborted': { kind: 'aborted'; failure: LlmFailure }
  'error': { kind: 'error'; failure: LlmFailure }
}
```

`FinishReason = FinishReasonMap[keyof FinishReasonMap]`. `TokenUsage` (per-call accounting with disjoint cache fields) is detailed [below](#tokenusage).

`GenerateOptions.tools` carries `ToolSchema` — the JSON-schema description of a tool, as sent to the model. It is declared in dsh-llm (not dsh-tools) precisely because it is part of the request the loop assembles every step:

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * JSON-schema description of a tool, as sent to the model.
 *
 * Declared here (not in dsh-tools) because it is part of {@link GenerateOptions};
 * dsh-tools' ToolDefinition and dsh-system-prompt's PromptAssembly both import
 * it from this package.
 */
interface ToolSchema {
  name: string
  description: string
  /** JSON Schema object for the arguments. */
  parameters: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

The model-facing `ToolSchema` is the wire shape; the registered `ToolDefinition` that produces it (schema + `execute`) is on [tools.md](tools.md).

### The request envelope: `LlmCallConfig` and the logged header

The loop builds each request from logged state. `EpochHeader` records call config, adapter-default provenance, rendered prompt, and authoritative returned tool order (configured by `toolOrder`, or lexicographic when unset) through full `request/header` snapshots. Together with derived history, this makes the request reconstructable from the session log. See [session.md](session.md#the-request-header-event-requestheader) and the [reconstructability Agent Note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-05-reconstructable-requests.md).

`agent/request` receives a frozen call-config seed and may return a replacement to switch provider, model, reasoning effort, or sampling. Before the waterfall, the loop removes values marked as adapter defaults so exact-model preparation materializes the selected route's current values; unmarked explicit settings remain in the proposal. After the waterfall, preparation rejects unsupported explicit effort ids without clamping and logs the effective config plus provenance under the turn signal. The prepared call keeps one adapter registration through dispatch. Requests reaching `llm/stream` are deep-frozen, so mutation throws, and carry a process-local loop identity so observers do not confuse separately logged frozen auxiliary calls with conversation requests.

On the wire, a loop-built request reads the `system` slot (the rendered prompt assembly) followed by the derived history — the boundary snapshot, whose tail is the newest `user/message` on a turn's first step and the previous step's tool results on later steps. The dev invariant recomputes exactly this equation against every loop-built request.

FIXME(call-config-shape): revisit which remaining fields are genuinely epoch-level for cache purposes (`model` and the model-owned reasoning effort are explicit; the sampling scalars sit here out of caution).

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Provider, model, reasoning effort, and sampling scalars of one conversation's
 * requests. Every field maps 1:1 onto the same-named `GenerateOptions` field;
 * the loop builds requests from the logged header rather than accepting these
 * per call.
 */
interface LlmCallConfig {
  provider: string
  model: string
  reasoningEffort?: ReasoningEffortId
  temperature?: number
  maxTokens?: number
  stop?: string[]
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/**
 * Effective config fields supplied by exact-model adapter resolution rather
 * than by the caller's request proposal.
 */
interface LlmCallConfigAdapterDefaults {
  reasoningEffort?: true
  maxTokens?: true
}
```

## The seam

`LlmAdapter` is the provider seam: subclass, implement `stream()`, and register one adapter instance with `ctx.llm.registerAdapter(providers, adapter)`. `GenerateOptions.provider` selects the registered adapter; `GenerateOptions.model` is passed to that adapter and need not be registered at lifecycle start. Duplicate provider routes fail atomically. Optional `providerRetryPolicy()` is captured per route with normal defaults, while `providerInfo()` and asynchronous `listModels()` feed `LlmService.listProviders()` / `listModels()` with detached selector metadata. That catalog is advisory rather than a request whitelist: the adapter remains authoritative and may accept unlisted model ids. One asynchronous `resolveModel()` query returns exact model identity plus optional correctness-sensitive context capacity, an adapter-configured `defaultMaxTokens`, and ordered model-owned reasoning ids with an optional deployment default; absent fields mean unavailable metadata or provider-owned behavior, not invalid catalog membership. The resolver receives optional cancellation and must settle promptly after abort. `LlmService.resolveModelInfo()` validates and detaches the aggregate. At the final adapter boundary, `resolveCallConfig()` materializes the output default only when `maxTokens` is absent and validates and materializes reasoning, so direct calls cannot bypass either configured behavior; direct dispatch captures one registration before awaiting that resolution. The agent loop instead uses `prepareCall()` to keep the same registration across model resolution, durable header logging, and dispatch, retain detached context metadata from that exact lookup, and report which config fields the adapter defaulted. Adapter lookup happens at the terminal continuation of the `llm/stream` waterfall, so a listener may short-circuit the call or route a mutable one-shot request before lookup. AgentLoop observes a request attempt once the outer waterfall returns a stream handle; that limited boundary does not prove a lazy terminal adapter was constructed or began provider I/O. The `block-start` / `block-end` `index` correlation and the assembler together mean an adapter only has to emit well-formed chunks — block reassembly is not each adapter's problem. The consumer surface (`ctx.llm.stream()`) and the `llm/stream` waterfall are described in [architecture.md § Content blocks and streaming](../architecture.md#content-blocks-and-streaming-dsh-llm).

## Cordis surface

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` surface lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.llm` — `LlmService`

The abstract `llm` service: an adapter registry plus a streaming model-call surface, interceptable via the `llm/stream` waterfall.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register an adapter for the given provider routes. Throws `LlmError` with code
 * `DUPLICATE_ADAPTER` if any provider already has an adapter (all-or-nothing).
 * Disposed with the fiber.
 * @param providers - every provider route this adapter should serve.
 * @param adapter - the adapter that streams calls for those providers.
 * @returns the disposer, carrying {@link AdapterRegistrationHandle.replace}.
 */
registerAdapter(providers: string[], adapter: LlmAdapter): AdapterRegistrationHandle

/**
 * Describe provider routes with a registered adapter.
 * @returns detached provider metadata in registration order.
 */
listProviders(): LlmProviderInfo[]

/**
 * Declare provider routes an adapter plugin can activate through
 * configuration. Registration is all-or-nothing: an empty list, invalid
 * entry, or a provider already declared by any registration throws
 * `LlmError` without registering the rest. Disposed with the fiber.
 * @param entries - every configurable provider this plugin owns.
 * @returns the disposer that withdraws all of them.
 */
registerConfigurableProviders(entries: readonly LlmConfigurableProvider[]): () => void

/**
 * List every declared configurable provider, registered or dormant.
 * @returns detached directory entries in declaration order.
 */
listConfigurableProviders(): LlmConfigurableProvider[]

/**
 * Resolve the retry policy captured when one provider route was registered.
 * @param provider - registered provider route to inspect.
 * @returns the provider-owned policy, with normal defaults already resolved.
 */
providerRetryPolicy(provider: string): ResolvedRetryPolicy

/**
 * Discover models advertised by one registered provider. Catalog membership
 * is advisory and never changes routing or request validation.
 * @param provider - registered provider route to inspect.
 * @returns detached model metadata in adapter-preferred order.
 */
async listModels(provider: string): Promise<LlmModelInfo[]>

/**
 * Resolve and validate all metadata from the adapter that owns one exact
 * route. The result is detached from adapter-owned objects; catalog
 * membership remains advisory and does not control request routing.
 * @param provider - registered provider route to inspect.
 * @param model - exact model id passed to the adapter.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned asynchronous lookup.
 * @returns exact model identity plus available context and reasoning metadata.
 */
async resolveModelInfo( provider: string, model: string, signal?: AbortSignal, ): Promise<LlmResolvedModelInfo>

/**
 * Validate a conversation call config against its exact model capability and
 * materialize adapter-configured defaults. Unsupported explicit efforts
 * reject before provider I/O; no clamping or aliasing is performed. This
 * standalone query does not bind a later dispatch; use {@link prepareCall}
 * when logging and streaming must share one adapter registration.
 * @param config - provider/model route and optional request controls.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned capability lookup.
 * @returns a detached config only when a default must be materialized.
 */
async resolveCallConfig(config: LlmCallConfig, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<LlmCallConfig>

/**
 * Resolve one call under its current adapter registration. The returned
 * one-shot handle keeps that registration across header logging and dispatch,
 * so HMR cannot combine one adapter's capability result with another adapter.
 * @param config - provider/model route and optional request controls.
 * @param signal - optional cancellation for adapter-owned capability lookup.
 * @returns a prepared config and its registration-bound stream entry point.
 */
async prepareCall(config: LlmCallConfig, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<PreparedLlmCall>

/**
 * Stream one model call as raw chunks (token-level deltas). Throws
 * `LlmError` with code `NO_ADAPTER` if no adapter is registered for
 * `options.provider`. Replay state is retained only when the same adapter
 * instance owns its historical provider and the target provider. Final
 * adapter selection remains fixed through asynchronous exact-model resolution
 * and dispatch. Selection, dispatch, and iteration failures retain their
 * original Error identity and are tagged in a call-local scope for narrow
 * agent-loop request recovery; middleware and nested-call failures remain
 * untagged for the outer call.
 * @param options - the full request; `options.provider` selects the adapter.
 * @returns the chunk stream, possibly wrapped by `llm/stream` listeners.

### `llm/*` events

<a id="llmadapters-updated--emit"></a>

#### `llm/adapters-updated` — emit

The provider topology changed: an adapter registered or unregistered routes, or the configurable-provider directory gained or lost entries. This is a payload-free registry notification fired at each commit point (including registration disposal); consumers re-read `listProviders()`, `listModels()`, or `listConfigurableProviders()` for the new state. Observer failures are contained and cannot veto the registry mutation.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**

<a id="llmstream--waterfall"></a>

#### `llm/stream` — waterfall

Waterfall around every streaming model call (retry, replay, routing). Bound to the LlmService; call `next()` to reach the resolved adapter's stream, or yield your own chunks to short-circuit.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Waterfall around every streaming model call (retry, replay, routing).
 * Bound to the {@link LlmService}; call `next()` to reach the resolved
 * adapter's stream, or yield your own chunks to short-circuit.
 * @param options - the full request. A LOOP-built request carries the
 *   process-local {@link markAgentLoopRequest} identity and arrives deep-frozen
 *   (mutation throws): its content is a pure function of the session log (the
 *   reconstructability Agent Note), so listeners read it, never rewrite it.
 *   Hand-built calls do not carry that marker; their messages already obey
 *   the immutable creation contract.
 * @mode waterfall
