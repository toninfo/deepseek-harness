# Use the Web UI

English | [中文](index.zh.md)

Start the Web UI through the [root README](../../../README.md#run); the command prints its URL. This guide begins after that server is running.

The invoking directory is the default workspace, so the agent can inspect and modify the project where you started `dsh`.

## Configure a model

Open **Settings → Models**, enter a DeepSeek API key, and save it. The model route becomes usable immediately without restarting the server.

The [model configuration guide](./providers.md) covers other providers and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Run a task

Start a session and send:

> Summarize this repository and identify its main packages.

The agent can read and edit workspace files, run commands, delegate work, and maintain a plan. The Web UI asks before operations that require approval under the active permission policy.
