# Configure models

English | [中文](providers.zh.md)

This guide assumes you started the Web UI through the [root README](../../../README.md#run). Model changes take effect on the next request without restarting the server.

## Configure DeepSeek

Open **Settings → Models**. The DeepSeek card exposes one API-key field; enter the key and save it.

Keys are write-only. The page receives a redacted descriptor after saving, never the literal secret. The key is stored in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`, while settings retain only its credential reference.

## Add a catalog provider

Choose **Add provider**, select a provider such as Anthropic or OpenAI, enter its API key, and save. The installed catalog supplies the endpoint, protocol, and model list.

Providers with native authentication need their native credentials instead. Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, and Codex use AWS credentials and a region, an ADC project, an `api-version`, and OAuth respectively; filling only the API-key field does not configure them.

## Add a custom provider

Choose **Add a custom provider** for a company gateway, self-hosted server, or provider absent from the installed catalog. Supply a lowercase Provider ID, base URL, API protocol, credential, and at least one model.

The Provider ID is permanent because requests, saved sessions, model defaults, and credential references use it. To rename a provider, add a new provider and delete the old one. The display name, base URL, protocol, credential, and models remain editable.

Under **Model catalog**, choose **Fetch available models** to query the base URL and credential currently shown in the form. Selecting candidates updates the draft; the provider is not stored until you save. Catalog providers use their installed catalog without a network request.

## Select a model

Configured providers appear in the model picker. Selecting a model also makes it the default for new sessions. A session that has already sent a request retains the model recorded in its own log.

If a saved default names a provider that was deleted, the composer displays **Select model** and blocks input until another model is selected.

## Troubleshooting

- **`MISSING_CREDENTIAL`** — Store the provider key through the Models page or supply the referenced environment variable.
- **`UNKNOWN_MODEL`** — Select a configured model or add the missing model to the custom provider.
- **Fetching available models returns 401** — Check the key. Model discovery calls the OpenAI-compatible `GET /models` endpoint; enter models manually for endpoints that do not provide it.

## Advanced configuration

The generated [plugin configuration catalog](../../config-catalog.md) lists every supported field and default. The [`dsh-llm-pi-ai`](../../../packages/llm/llm-pi-ai/README.md) and [`dsh-llm-deepseek`](../../../packages/llm/llm-deepseek/README.md) references own direct `settings.yaml` configuration, catalog resolution, reasoning controls, credentials, and adapter errors.
