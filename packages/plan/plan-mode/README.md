# @deepseek-ai/dsh-plan-mode

Logged, per-agent plan collaboration state with deployment-owned guidance, direct `/plan [message]` entry and `/plan off` exit commands, and the reviewed `exit_plan_mode` exit. Plan mode is soft guidance; sandbox mode and approval policy remain independent enforcement axes.

## Durable state

`plan/mode` (`{ active: boolean }`) is a log-only, whole-value-replace `SessionEventMap` member. `foldPlanMode(events)` returns the last logged value or `false`, so resume, fork, and compaction recover plan state directly from the session log. UIs observe committed flips through `session/event`.

`ctx.planMode.set(agent, active)` records a pending selection and flushes it inside the next turn boundary. `get(agent)` returns `{ active, pending? }`, separating the logged state shaping the current step from a user's optimistic selection. Prompt submission, ordinary continuation, and request-recovery retry are all covered; a changed user selection contributes one plugin-sourced `user/message` notice when the last logged request header described the other state.

## Model and human surfaces

While active, `plan:policy` renders the configured `section`. The plugin always registers `exit_plan_mode`, keeping tool schemas stable across the transition; its execute path accepts only active plan mode and leaves it only after an exact user approval through `ctx.userInteraction`.

When `ctx.commands` is composed, the package registers `/plan [message]` and reserves the exact argument `off` for direct exit. Bare `/plan` selects plan mode; any other non-empty argument selects it first and is then submitted through `agent.steer()`, so it becomes the next step's ordinary logged user message under plan guidance. `/plan off` selects inactive without sending model input; it also cancels a pending entry before plan mode reaches a request.

ACP is an adapter, not the owner of this vocabulary: it advertises the fixed wire ids `default` and `plan`, maps `session/set_mode` to the boolean service, and translates committed `plan/mode` events back to `current_mode_update`.

## Configuration

```yaml
- id: plan-mode
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-plan-mode'
  config:
    section: |
      You are in plan mode. Explore and design before presenting the complete
      plan through exit_plan_mode.
```

`section` is required and non-empty. Unknown keys fail at load. The package does not accept arbitrary named modes, tool filters, sandbox settings, or approval policy.

Design: [plan-mode Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-07-plan-mode.md) and [plan-specific state simplification](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/simplification/2026-07-22-plan-specific-collaboration-state.md).

## Model Experience

### Plan policy system prompt

#### What the model sees

While plan mode is active, the model sees the deployment's exact `section` text at prompt order 50; inactive mode contributes no text.

##### Configuration example

```markdown
You are in plan mode. Explore and design before presenting the complete plan through exit_plan_mode.
```

#### Token effect

Inactive mode adds no tokens; active mode adds the configured section to every request.

#### KV Cache effect

The section is stable within plan mode, but entering or leaving changes the system prompt from order 50 onward.

### Human command

#### What the model sees

`/plan`, `/plan off`, and their terminal results stay outside model history. A non-empty suffix other than the exact `off` argument becomes one trimmed user text block through `agent.steer()` after plan mode is selected. An active `/plan off` selection contributes the standard logged user-switch notice only when the last request header described plan mode; cancelling a pending entry contributes none because no request observed it.

#### Token effect

The optional message costs the same history tokens as submitting that text separately; bare `/plan` and `/plan off` add none. A narrated active exit adds the small retained switch notice.

#### KV Cache effect

The user block is append-only conversation growth. Entering or leaving plan mode changes the earlier policy section; a narrated exit notice is appended after the reusable request prefix.

### Exit tool schema and review exchange

#### What the model sees

The [`exit_plan_mode` schema](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-plan-mode) remains available in both states; execution outside plan mode fails, while an approved in-mode review returns the canonical `{ approved: true }` value and renders the existing confirmation text. Rejection remains a failed call carrying review feedback.

#### Token effect

The stable schema is paid according to ToolRegistry mode, and each plan argument and review result remains in conversation history.

#### KV Cache effect

Mode transitions do not change the tool catalog; plan arguments and review results extend the conversation normally.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Plan mode guides rather than enforces; deployments needing a hard boundary must combine independent sandbox and approval controls.
- A pending selection made while idle is lost if the process exits before the next boundary, so the UI must reapply it.
- Forked agents inherit logged plan state, while newly spawned agents begin inactive; there is no creation-time plan option.
