# Packages

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Packages use the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` scope. Cordis `Service` subclasses and function plugins contribute through `ctx.effect()`, `ctx.on()`, or `ctx.waterfall()`. Authoring rules: [package](AGENTS.md) and [root](../AGENTS.md#conventions).

## Hierarchy

Packages live at `packages/<group>/<pkg>/`; groups are containers, while names remain `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<pkg>`. **Each group README is the canonical package/ctx-key map.**

New packages join existing groups; new groups update their README and this table.

## Dependencies

The dependency graph is generated: [docs/module-graph.md](../docs/module-graph.md) (`pnpm run gen-module-graph`, freshness-gated in CI).

**Extension plugins depend on interfaces, never the concrete loop.** `dsh-agent-loop` is swappable; UI, hook, and tool plugins use `dsh-agent`. Composition bundles, including `dsh-agent-spine-demo`, may depend on spine plugins. Capabilities split into interface / implementation / consumer packages; see [capability seams](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-06-13-capability-seams.md).

Package READMEs cover purpose, APIs, extension points, and [Model Experience](../docs/cookbook/adding-a-package.md#4-write-the-package-readme) unless on the model-agnostic [omission allowlist](../scripts/verify-package-readme-model-experience.ts). They also carry `## Known Limitations and Deferred Work` or use its [allowlist](../scripts/verify-package-readme-limitations.ts).
