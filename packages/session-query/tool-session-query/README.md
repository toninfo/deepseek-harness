# @deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-session-query

Workspace-authorized model tools over `ctx.sessionQuery`. The package depends only on the unified interface and registers `session_search`, `session_event_search`, `session_trace`, `session_event_trace`, and `session_event_read`.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `maxSearchResults` | `100` | Maximum authorized non-self hits collected across internal provider pages |
| `searchTimeoutMs` | `30000` | Cooperative deadline attached to both full-text search tools |

The caller comes exclusively from `ToolExecution.exec.agent`. Cross-session access requires exact equality between the target and caller session `cwd` values; a caller without `cwd` can inspect only itself. Search never exposes provider cursors, offsets, page sizes, or a model-controlled limit. Timestamps at the tool boundary require an explicit `Z` or numeric offset and become inclusive epoch-millisecond filters.

`session_search` always omits the caller session. A current-session `session_event_search` stops immediately before the step that invoked it, so the active assistant output and logged tool call cannot match themselves. Direct targets are authorized before trace, event, or title reads. Lineage output replaces unauthorized ancestor and descendant boundaries with markers that contain no hidden session id.

The package deliberately performs no byte or character truncation and does not import a spill backend. Deployments that need bounded inline output mount `@deepseek-ai/dsh-spill-policy`, which can replace the rendered text after execution while retaining the complete result.

## Model Experience

### System prompt

#### What the model sees

The model receives one fixed prior-history guidance section.

##### Prior-history guidance

```markdown
Use session_search to find relevant work from prior sessions, or session_event_search to search earlier events in one session. Search results are cursor-free and workspace-scoped. Follow a useful hit with session_trace, session_event_trace, or session_event_read when you need lineage, relationships, or exact data.
```

#### Token effect

One fixed concise section is present on each request while the plugin is mounted.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the plugin and guidance text are unchanged.

### Tool schemas

#### What the model sees

The model sees the generated [`session_search`, `session_event_search`, `session_trace`, `session_event_trace`, and `session_event_read` schemas](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-tool-session-query). Search filters add fixed schema tokens, while cursors, workspace paths, output pagination, and model-controlled result limits remain absent.

#### Token effect

Five fixed read-only schemas are sent on each request while visible.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while tool visibility and definitions are unchanged.

### Tool results

#### What the model sees

Each successful call emits one plain-text block. Search results include titles and best-match excerpts; traces include all authorized relationships; event reads include unabridged target JSON. The generic spill policy may replace oversized inline text with its preview, opaque locator, and retrieval hint.

#### Token effect

Results are data-dependent and remain in logged tool history until compaction; `maxSearchResults` bounds search-hit count.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only result text follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate earlier cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Search returns at most the deployment cap and asks the model to narrow its query when more matches exist; it offers no continuation token.
- Workspace identity is conservative exact-string `cwd` equality, so symlink-equivalent paths do not share authority.
- Custom compositions without the generic spill policy accept complete trace and event payloads inline.
