/**
 * Agent presets: each session composes its model-facing plugin set from one
 * preset `cordis.yml`, mounted ONCE per preset under a standing scope and
 * joined by every agent that names it.
 *
 * The standing mount is what makes a preset one composition rather than one
 * per session: its plugin instances, tool registrations, prompt sections, and
 * projection units exist exactly once, keyed per session inside the plugins
 * themselves (they predate presets and were written for a shared world). An
 * agent joins by having its scope key parented to the mount's
 * ({@link setScopeParent}), which makes the mount's registrations visible to
 * that agent's views and the mount's listeners receive that agent's events —
 * and a host reader with no agent at all (a cold transcript read) resolves
 * the same standing registrations by preset id.
 *
 * This package owns the preset vocabulary, filesystem discovery, and the
 * guarded standing mount. It does not decide when an agent is created — the
 * agent factory's `setup(agentCtx)` hook is the one supported call site,
 * because only there is the join installed while the agent is still
 * unpublished, so a rejected composition rolls the whole creation back.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets
