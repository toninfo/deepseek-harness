# @deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-fs

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The **model-facing filesystem tools** — `read`, `write`, `edit` — and their **executor**. This is the consumer layer of the filesystem stack: it owns tool names, JSON schemas, argument validation, prompt sections, **read windowing**, and result formatting. It reads/writes/edits through the `ctx.fs` provider contract ([`@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs`](../fs)) **directly**. The freshness/observation policy is contributed by a separate plugin ([`@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-policy`](../fs-policy)) through the `fs/*` event gate; the tool is not method-coupled to it. Under a confining provider, the shared sandbox-policy service is required for per-session execution and the tool exposes escalation for filesystem mutations.

```ts ignore-check
// Default deployment: a ctx.fs provider, the policy plugin, then the tools.
await ctx.plugin(LocalFileSystem, { cwd: process.cwd() }) // @deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-local
await ctx.plugin(FsPolicy)                             // @deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-policy (policy gate)
await ctx.plugin(ToolFs)                                  // this package — registers read/write/edit
```

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-policy` is **optional**: omit it and the tools run against the bare provider (unconditional write/overwrite/edit, no observed-state). A deployment that loads these tools is expected to also load it, so the behavior is read-before-write/edit.

## Config

All keys are optional; the defaults are the shipped read caps.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `readLimit` | `2000` | Default and maximum lines returned by one `read` call (the tool schema advertises it as the `limit` default). |
| `readMaxLineLength` | `2000` | Characters kept per line before truncation (the suffix names the cap). |
| `readMaxBytes` | `51200` | Byte cap on one `read` call's selected lines; overflow ends the window with a "capped" footer. |
| `readStreamMinSize` | `10485760` | Files at or above this size (or with unknown size) stream instead of loading whole into memory. |

## Tools (schemas per [the filesystem tool schemas Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-06-17-filesystem-tool-schemas.md))

| Tool | Arguments | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | `file_path`, `offset?`, `limit?` | Line-numbered UTF-8 content with a pagination footer. `offset` is 1-based; `limit` defaults to and caps at the configured `readLimit` (2000). |
| `write` | `file_path`, `content` | Create or fully replace a file. With the policy plugin: overwriting an existing file requires a prior `read` at the unchanged version; creating a new file does not. Without it: unconditional. |
| `edit` | `file_path`, non-empty `old_string`, `new_string`, `replace_all?` | Literal replacement; unique match required unless `replace_all` is true. With the policy plugin: requires a prior `read` (any window) and the file unchanged since. Without it: unconditional. |

Field names are snake_case to match Claude Code and existing harness tool schemas.

Canonical successes are `read` → `{ path, offset, lines: [{ number, text }], totalLines }`, `write` → `{ path, operation: 'create' | 'update', before: string | null, after }`, and `edit` → `{ path, before, after }`. Native renderers preserve the line-numbered read and mutation acknowledgements below. `write`/`edit` derive replayable diff-card metadata, and `read` derives a replayable read-card window `{ path, offset, lines, totalLines, lang? }`, from these canonical values; the canonical values themselves are execution-local and are not added to `tool/result`, only the derived presentation metadata is persisted.

## The tool is the executor; policy is an event gate

The tools do **not** inject a policy service or inspect any cache. Each tool resolves the path via `ctx.fs.resolve(path, { cwd, signal })` — passing the calling agent's session cwd (`exec.agent.session.header.cwd`) so a relative path resolves against the session's workspace, matching `dsh-tool-bash`, and forwarding tool cancellation through resolution (see [the per-session cwd Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-02-fs-per-session-cwd.md)) — then:

- **read** — one `ctx.fs.stat` (type + size routing + version), then `readText`/`streamText`, then builds the line window, then emits `fs/observed` with a plain `ctx.emit`. (1 stat.)
- **write** — `ctx.waterfall('fs/write-intent', target, exec, () => undefined)` for the optional guard, then `ctx.fs.writeText(target, content, intent)`, then `fs/observed`. (0 stat.)
- **edit** — `ctx.waterfall('fs/edit-intent', target, exec, () => undefined)` for the optional guard, then `ctx.fs.editText(target, edit, intent)`, then `fs/observed`. (0 stat.)

The tool passes `exec` (the tool-execution context) as the opaque `actor` on every dispatch. The default thunks return `undefined` (the unconstrained bare provider). When `@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-policy` is loaded it occupies the single decision slot — returning `createIfAbsent`/`replaceIfVersion`/`{ version }` or throwing `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` — and records on `fs/observed`. Backend errors (`FsError`) and a thrown `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` flow through `ToolRegistry.execute()` and become `isError` tool results with their `{ name, code }` attached.

When `ctx.fs.sandboxMode` reports confinement, write/edit advertise `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` and resolve approved retries through `ctx.approval`. The policy owner contributes capability-neutral standing policy; the tool results retain operation-specific denial and retry guidance.

## `fs/observed` is fire-and-forget

`fs/observed` fires AFTER the read/write/edit already succeeded, via a plain `ctx.emit`. A listener is contractually a synchronous, side-effect-only recorder (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-fs-policy`'s is a `WeakMap.set`); the tool does not guard the emit, so a listener that throws would surface as the tool's `isError` result — async or fallible observation does not belong on this event.

`read` opts into concurrent scheduling because its only mutation is the synchronous version recorder. Recorder races fail closed when a later `write` or `edit` re-checks the version under its target lock; both mutation tools remain exclusive. See the [parallel tool-call Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-10-parallel-tool-call-execution.md).

The package root exports only the Cordis plugin contract (`name`, `inject`, `Config`, and `apply`). Read rendering (line windowing + output formatting) lives in `src/read-render.ts` (Cordis-free, independently unit-tested); `src/read.ts`/`write.ts`/`edit.ts` are the tool executors and `src/index.ts` composes them.

## Model Experience

### System prompt

#### What the model sees

Every request in this plugin's registration scope receives the independently registered read, write, and edit guidance below. Scoped tool restrictions can hide schemas without removing these sections.

##### Read guidance

```markdown
Use the read tool — not shell commands like cat — to inspect text files. Results include line numbers. Use offset and limit to continue reading large files.
```

##### Write guidance

```markdown
Use the write tool to create files or completely replace file contents. Existing files are overwritten, so read an existing file first (the default fs-policy requires it) and prefer edit for targeted changes.
```

##### Edit guidance

```markdown
Use the edit tool for targeted changes to existing UTF-8 text files. It replaces literal old_string with new_string; by default old_string must appear exactly once. If old_string appears multiple times, provide a more specific old_string or set replace_all to true. Read the file first (the default fs-policy requires it), unless you just created or edited it in this session.
```

#### Token effect

Fixed guidance cost per request while the plugin is active, even when a restriction hides one or more tools.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the plugin scope and guidance text are unchanged. Tool restrictions do not remove this section, but plugin activation or disposal may invalidate reuse from it.

### Tool schemas

#### What the model sees

The model sees the generated [`read`, `write`, and `edit` schemas](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-tool-fs), with snake_case arguments. Scoped tool restrictions can remove any definition for one agent.

#### Token effect

Fixed schema cost on every request in that tool view.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the visible tool definitions and order are unchanged. Registration lifecycle or scoped restrictions may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token.

### Read result

#### What the model sees

A successful read is exactly `<path><displayPath></path>`, newline, `<type>file</type>`, newline, `<content>`, numbered lines as `<lineNumber>: <text>`, a blank line, one footer, and `</content>`. The footer is exactly `(Output capped. Showing lines <start>-<end>. Use offset=<next> to continue.)`, `(Showing lines <start>-<end> of <total>. Use offset=<next> to continue.)`, or `(End of file - total <total> lines)`. A long line ends exactly `... (line truncated to <max> chars)`. A missing read still returns `FS_NOT_FOUND`, but it records confirmed absence for the calling session; after an externally deleted file is re-read, a retried `write` can safely recreate it through the provider's no-replace guard.

#### Token effect

Read output is capped by `readLimit`, `readMaxLineLength`, and `readMaxBytes`; the retained call and result are resent until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Write and edit results

#### What the model sees

Write returns the exact five-line envelope `<path><displayPath></path>`, `<type>file</type>`, `<content>`, `Created file` or `Updated file`, then `</content>`. Edit returns exactly `The file <displayPath> has been updated successfully.` or, for `replace_all`, `The file <displayPath> has been updated. All occurrences were successfully replaced.` The full write or replacement text remains in the assistant tool-call arguments.

#### Token effect

Success text is small, but large mutation arguments and any result are resent until compaction.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Tool errors

#### What the model sees

Failures are normalized as `Error: <message>`. This package's stable validation and read messages are `file_path must be a non-empty string`, `limit must be less than or equal to <max>`, `old_string must be a non-empty string`, `old_string and new_string must differ`, `cannot read "<path>": not found`, `cannot read "<path>": not a regular file`, and `offset <offset> is out of range for "<path>" (<total> lines)`; provider and policy templates are quoted in their package READMEs. Guarded-mutation failures additionally carry their recovery instruction in the message, appended by this package's model-facing error wrapper: `FS_STALE_VERSION` gets `— re-read the file, then retry`, and `FS_NOT_OBSERVED` gets `— read the file, then retry`; the structured code is preserved. After that reread confirms absence, edit reports `FS_NOT_FOUND` instead of repeating a stale remedy, while write uses guarded creation.

#### Token effect

Only a failing call adds these retained tokens.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **No model-facing directory listing ships** — `ctx.fs.listDir` serves provider code such as skill discovery, while the sibling [`dsh-tool-fs-search`](../tool-fs-search/) package supplies ripgrep-backed `glob` and `grep` rather than extending the filesystem seam.
- **`read` handles UTF-8 text files only** — binary-safe reads and PDF/image/multimodal content are deferred; a directory target is `FS_NOT_REGULAR_FILE`.
- **No timeout surface** — `read`/`write`/`edit` take no timeout argument and declare no `timeout-policy` budget; cancellation rides `exec.signal` only ([provider rationale](../README.md#no-timeouts-on-file-io)).
