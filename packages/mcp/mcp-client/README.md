# @deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

MCP client bridge plugin: connects to external [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers and registers their tools on `ctx.tools`, making them available to the model as native tools under server-qualified names (`mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>`).

## Usage

One plugin instance per MCP server in `cordis.yml`:

```yaml
- id: mcp-github
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: github
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-github']
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: !!js process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN

- id: mcp-web
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: web
    transport: streamable-http
    url: http://localhost:3000/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: !!js '`Bearer ${process.env.MCP_TOKEN}`'
```

The model sees `mcp__github__create_issue`, `mcp__web__search`, … — the same server-qualified shape Claude Code and Codex use. HMR hot-swaps: editing the entry triggers disconnect + reconnect without process restart; an unchanged `serverName` reproduces identical tool names.

## Config

| Field | Transport | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `transport` | both | yes | `"stdio"` or `"streamable-http"` |
| `serverName` | both | yes | Namespace for this server's model-facing tool names; `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`, unique across live instances |
| `command` | stdio | yes | Executable to spawn |
| `args` | stdio | no | Arguments passed to the command |
| `env` | stdio | no | Extra env vars merged on top of scrubbed ambient env |
| `cwd` | stdio | no | Working directory for the child process |
| `url` | http | yes | MCP server URL |
| `headers` | http | no | Extra headers (e.g. auth tokens) |
| `toolCallTimeoutMs` | both | no | Timeout per `callTool` invocation (default 60000) |
| `failOnStartupError` | both | no | Reject plugin activation when the initial connection or tool discovery fails (default `false`) |

## Tool naming

Every MCP tool has two names: the raw MCP name (sent on the wire in `tools/call`) and the public name `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` registered on `ctx.tools`. Public names are normalized to the DeepSeek function-name contract (64 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`); when replacement or truncation changes the name, a deterministic 12-hex-char hash of `(serverName, rawName)` is appended so distinct tools never collapse into one name. Names are pure functions of `(serverName, rawName)` — connection order, re-syncs, and other servers never rename a tool.

- Two servers publishing the same raw name (e.g. `search`) coexist under their namespaces.
- A duplicate `serverName` across live instances fails the later plugin instance at load.
- A server listing the same tool name twice is rejected as an invalid tool list.
- A foreign registration squatting on this server's namespace rolls back the whole generation (never a partial set), with a loud error.

## Behavior

- On connect: plugin activation awaits `listTools()` and registers each tool via `ctx.tools.register()` under its public name before the composition starts its first turn. Initial connection or discovery failure is always logged; it rejects activation when `failOnStartupError` is true and otherwise activates with no tools.
- Listens for `notifications/tools/list_changed` → re-syncs; a failed re-sync keeps the previous generation registered.
- Tool execute: `client.callTool({ name: rawName, arguments }, { signal })` with timeout + abort support—the public name is never sent to the server.
- Canonical success is `{ content: JsonValue[], structuredContent? }`; complete JSON MCP blocks survive for programmatic callers. A supported advertised `outputSchema` validates `structuredContent`; unsupported schema vocabulary falls back to unconstrained `JsonValue`.
- Native/model rendering keeps the existing text projection: text blocks join with newlines while image, audio, resource, and unsupported blocks become placeholders.
- On disconnect/crash: no auto-reconnect. Registered tools remain until plugin disposal or a successful re-sync, and calls can fail against the closed transport; reload with HMR or restart the Host to reconnect.

## Model Experience

### Discovered MCP tools

#### What the model sees

After initial discovery succeeds, each advertised MCP tool appears as a native tool named `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` (or its deterministic normalized form), with the server-provided description and input schema. A successful re-sync replaces the generation; plugin disposal removes it.

#### Token effect

Data-dependent schema cost is paid on every request while the tools are registered. Re-sync replaces rather than accumulates schemas, and the server-qualified name adds tokens to every tool definition and call.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the discovered tool set and schemas are unchanged. A re-sync that adds, removes, renames, or changes a tool replaces definitions and may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token.

### Tool-call history and results

#### What the model sees

The public tool name and JSON arguments remain in assistant history. Text result blocks are joined with newlines into one retained Native text result; image, audio, resource, and unsupported blocks become short placeholders there. Their full JSON blocks and optional structured content remain in the execution-local canonical value, and MCP `isError` rejects the call through the registry's error path.

#### Token effect

Arguments and mapped text are retained until compaction. Binary and resource payloads are discarded rather than added to context.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Tools are the only bridged MCP capability** — Resources and Prompts have no harness consumption surface and are deferred.
- **Crash recovery is manual** — transport closure does not auto-reconnect; registered tools can remain visible but fail against the closed transport until an HMR reload or Host restart.
- **Native non-text rendering is lossy** — image, audio, and resource payloads become placeholders in model context even though the execution-local canonical value preserves their JSON blocks. Richer Native multimedia projection is deferred.
- **Unsupported MCP output schemas are not enforced** — `structuredContent` falls back to `JsonValue` when the advertised schema uses vocabulary outside the harness subset.
