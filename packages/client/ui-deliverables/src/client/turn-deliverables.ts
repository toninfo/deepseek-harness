/**
 * Files produced by the turn the assistant at `seq` closes — the anchor the

 * work rather than after some mid-turn narration.
 *
 * The source is the mutation tools' own follow-along `locations`, not the
 * closing prose: a produced file must be listed whether or not the model
 * remembered to name it. A mutation is recognized by render intent, not by
 * tool name — a diff card, or a generic card whose `kind` is `edit` (the shape
 * `str_replace_editor`'s insert presents) — so a new mutation tool joins by
 * declaring what it does. Reads contribute nothing (looking at a file does not
 * produce it), and neither do deletes (there is nothing left to open) or
 * failed calls. Paths keep first-seen order and appear once, so a file written
 * and then edited in the same turn is one entry.
 *
 * Accumulation resets on the turn boundary — a user message, or a node
 * reporting a different turn number — so a turn that mutates files and then
 * ends without content text cannot spill its paths into the next turn's row,
 * nor leave the dedup set suppressing a file the next turn legitimately
 * rewrites. Tool results carry no turn of their own; the boundary is read off
 * the nodes that do, and a user message resets the tracked turn to undefined
 * because the next node to report one is stating the current turn, not
 * entering a new one.
 * @param nodes - snapshot nodes (surface order).
 * @param seq - the closing assistant's seq (the render site's anchor).
 * @returns Produced paths in first-seen order; empty when the turn wrote nothing.
