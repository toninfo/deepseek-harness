English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Settings ownerless-copy and product-onboarding plugin: registers everything on the Settings surface that belongs to no single feature — the shell's trigger/header/close chrome content, the local configuration-file action, the General section and its `settings.general.item` slot, the `settings` dictionaries, and the first ordered welcome step. Feature-owned rows (Permission, Language, Appearance), sections (Models), and conditional onboarding steps stay with their feature packages.

A loopback browser loads the provider's `hasDocument` capability through `settings.describe` and renders **Open configuration file** only when the Host confirms that a provider-owned local document can be prepared. The action sends the pathless, loopback-only `settings.openDocument` request; the Host resolves the provider path again, materializes an absent document, and hands it to a native text editor (`open -t` on macOS, bypassing a browser file association; the desktop file association on Linux and Windows; Windows association after `wslpath -w` translation on WSL). Open failures keep the action available and render a localized error. Reopening the dialog or reconnecting refreshes availability after a transient read failure or Host topology change. Remote browsers never register the action and never issue the privileged settings read.

`src/onboarding-copy.ts` is the single editable owner of the complete notice plus `WELCOME_NOTICE_VERSION`; both supported GUI locales intentionally render the same Chinese copy. The Host half registers `ui-onboarding` in the user-settings seam. A loopback browser compares `welcomeNoticeVersion` for exact equality and writes the current value only after Continue succeeds. The path mutation is idempotent across tabs and preserves sibling settings, while `host/settings-changed` makes an externally acknowledged notice advance without a reload. A non-loopback browser cannot access the privileged settings API: it still presents the notice, but Continue advances only the current browser process and a reload presents the notice again. A different version deliberately presents the notice again. The welcome page preserves every authored paragraph, gives the requested clause in the final paragraph the sole emphasis, initially focuses the title, and has no close, Escape, mask-click, or secondary path. None of its copy or acknowledgement enters a Session log or model request. The notice states that session telemetry is disabled by default and names the `FEEDBACK_ONLY` and `FULL` opt-in modes.

## Model Experience

None, as the plugin renders browser settings UI; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- The General section has no built-in rows; each row appears only when its owning feature plugin is mounted.
