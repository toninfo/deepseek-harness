/**
 * Client module system: the browser peer of Node's internal ESM loader, built
 * as a lazy CJS table. The vendored cordis Loader consumes this object
 * through its `internal` seam (the only call site is `EntryTree.import` →
 * `internal.import`), which keeps entry governance (fiber lifecycle, inject
 * waiting, update/refresh) entirely on the vendored side while this package
 * owns code arrival.
 *
 * Lazy CJS model (web2 §0): executing a plugin bundle only REGISTERS its
 * factory (`window.__ModuleLoader__.load({id, factory})`); every module body
 * side effect — including CSS injection — lives inside the factory closure
 * and runs at materialization, not at script execution. Materialization
 * (factory(require) → export surface) happens on first import/require and is
 * memoized in {@link ClientModuleLoader.loadCache}; a factory that requires
 * another registered-but-unmaterialized module materializes it recursively,
 * so load order needs no external sequencing.
 *
 * Resolution branch order (import): seed word → shell instance; memoized
 * record → surface; static registry (shell-own modules, e.g. app-shell) →
 * module; registered factory → materialize; graph row → fetch + execute +
 * materialize; anything else → throw (loud — the runtime mirror of the
 * build-time bundle purity gate). The synchronous `require` handed to
 * factories walks the same order minus the fetch branch: fetching is async,
 * so only already-executed bundles can be required — and cross-plugin value
 * imports are a build error anyway.
