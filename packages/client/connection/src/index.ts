 * configuration and `credentials.describe` reports whether an arbitrary

 * reconnaissance no anonymous caller should have. `trustedHosts` is a
 * DNS-rebinding fence, explicitly not authentication, so the whole
 * configuration plane stays loopback-same-origin until a real authentication
 * layer exists. `llm.discoverModels` belongs to that plane on both counts: it
 * carries a draft credential, and it makes the HOST issue a GET to a URL the
 * caller chose and reports back the status or the parsed body — an anonymous
 * LAN caller would have a probe for whatever the host can reach and the
 * browser cannot.
 *
 * The model catalog (`llm.providers`, `llm.models`) is deliberately NOT here:
 * it carries provider ids, display names, and model lists — no endpoints,
 * keys, or key state — and a LAN client's model picker legitimately needs it.
