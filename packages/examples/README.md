# examples/ — ready-to-run demo bundles

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Pre-composed plugin bundles a thin leaf `cordis.yml` loads instead of assembling the spine and a front door by hand. These are **demo / reference** packages — the `-demo` npm suffix marks each one as non-product surface, readable straight off the package name. The runnable leaves under the repo-root [`examples/`](../../examples/AGENTS.md) and the [Python SDK runtime](../../python/sdk-runtime/README.md) are the consumers; each is just its swappable backends plus one bundle entry.

| Package | npm name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [`agent-spine-demo/`](agent-spine-demo/README.md) | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-spine-demo` | Reusable agent-spine bundle |
| [`cli-demo/`](cli-demo/README.md) | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-cli-demo` | Headless one-shot application bundle |
| [`acp-demo/`](acp-demo/README.md) | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-acp-demo` | ACP automation application bundle |
| [`jsonrpc-demo/`](jsonrpc-demo/README.md) | `@deepseek-ai/dsh-jsonrpc-demo` | External-config JSON-RPC runtime |

`agent-spine-demo` is the shared bundle; `cli-demo` and `acp-demo` add their front doors, while `jsonrpc-demo` boots a deployment-owned plugin tree.

These packages are not product API. Product seams and front doors remain in their owning groups; demo bundles select concrete compositions.

Do not confuse this group with the repo-root [`examples/`](../../examples/AGENTS.md): that directory holds the runnable `cordis.yml` **leaves**; this group holds the **bundles** those leaves load.
