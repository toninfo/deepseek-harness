# @deepseek-ai/dsh-tasks-local

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Process-local implementation of the [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tasks`](../tasks/README.md) registry contract: `LocalTaskService` keeps every record in memory, issues per-kind `<kind>-N` ids, and hands out fresh snapshots, never live state. It has no config; load it as a plugin and it registers as `ctx.tasks`.

## Lifecycle

Tasks belong to their owner and backend, not the producer tool fiber, so producer and controller reloads do not stop them. The first task for an owner attaches one awaited effect to the exact `Agent` scope. Owner disposal cancels that object's tasks, awaits producer quiescence, and removes their snapshots; reused agent or session ids cannot redirect an old cleanup.

Service disposal closes listeners, cancels all live tasks, awaits their records, and detaches effects from surviving owner scopes. If teardown cancellation throws, the service force-fails the record and warns that work may be orphaned instead of deadlocking. A cancellation that returns but never settles `done` remains indistinguishable from a slow stop and can stall teardown.

Settlement is first-wins: the earliest terminal outcome — producer settlement, a rejected `done` contained as `failed`, or a teardown force-failure — records once, releases waiters, and notifies listeners once with per-listener containment. Pending waits mark the task reported before listeners run so completion reporters do not duplicate notices, and a teardown cancel marks it for the same reason: nothing will read a notice addressed to an owner being destroyed. Completion is the last thing a settlement announces, after the record is committed and the visible-set change is published, because a reporter may open a model turn synchronously and every other observer must already have seen the settled record.

Controllers and listeners are layered by the scope that registered them, in the tools-registry shape: a registration files into its registering context's scope, and a read unions the global layer with the owner's scope chain. One process-wide registry therefore answers per-owner questions per owner — `start()` refuses `background tasks unavailable: no task controller serves this agent (load @deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-tasks in its composition)` for an owner whose own composition attaches none, however many other compositions attach theirs, and a settlement reaches only the listeners its owner's composition registered.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through producer plugins and [`dsh-tool-tasks`](../tool-tasks/README.md), which render task ids, output, status, cancellation, and completion notices.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct invalidation; the named consumer owns any request-prefix changes.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Tasks are process-local** — records die with the harness process; durable or cross-restart execution needs a separate backend implementing the seam.
- **A silently ineffective cancel can stall teardown** — only an explicit throw can be force-failed safely.
