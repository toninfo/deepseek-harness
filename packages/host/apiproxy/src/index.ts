/**
 * @deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy — the API gateway every client shape shares:
 * the ApiProxy contract (api/: types + zod schemas, browser-safe), the fetch
 * carrier pair (fetch/: toFetchHandler on the host side, AbstractApiClient +
 * platform subclasses on the client side), and the host-side implementation
 * (api-proxy.ts: createApiProxy + the ApiProxyService gateway plugin providing
 * `ctx.apiProxy`). Transport-agnostic by design: this package registers no
 * routes — physical carriers wrap `ctx.apiProxy` themselves.
 *
 * The gateway also owns the `api-gateway` settings section: the route a
 * session starts from when its own log names none. The composition entry is
 * the shipped default and the section layers the user's choice over it, so
 * switching models in a conversation is what sets the default for the next
 * one. Sessions that have already logged a route are never retargeted by it.
