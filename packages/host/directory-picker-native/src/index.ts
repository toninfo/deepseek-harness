 * Windows opens the modern `IFileOpenDialog` in-process — a koffi-driven COM
 * conversation on a worker thread — and falls back to a PowerShell-hosted
 * dialog (`pwsh`, then Windows PowerShell 5.1) when that native surface is
 * unavailable). Only viable when the operator sits at the host's screen;
 * remote deployments compose the browse backend instead.
