# Agent Note: Telemetry requires explicit opt-in

Status: implemented

## Problem

DeepSeek Harness has two outbound telemetry feeds. During internal testing, the shared base mounted telemetry with a baked-in production endpoint, and both feeds reported by default to help diagnose reported problems: the session OTel backend could export complete session content, tool data, prompts, and workspace paths when its mode was omitted, while the dsh-sdk launcher feed did so unconditionally. A fresh installation therefore permitted outbound reporting without a positive deployment choice.

## Decision

Both feeds use `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE` as their positive consent setting. Unset and empty values resolve to `DISABLED`. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-telemetry-otel` also resolves an omitted `mode` to `DISABLED`, which constructs no OTel provider, processor, or exporter and leaves feedback in the local session log. The shared dsh base keeps the backend row mounted so disabled feedback can still explain that nothing was shared. A deployment opts into Session Log sharing through `FULL` or `FEEDBACK_ONLY`; only `FULL` also permits dsh-sdk launcher reporting. Any non-empty `DSH_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` remains an authoritative pre-load hard opt-out. The [default-mount decision](2026-07-31-web-telemetry-default-mount.md) continues to own the endpoint, batching cadence, and exit-drain settings.

The dsh-sdk launcher reads the same variable without parsing `cordis.yml` or booting Cordis. `FULL` permits reporting; `FEEDBACK_ONLY`, `DISABLED`, unset, and empty values deny it. This rule supersedes only the default-on launcher consent in the [SDK follow-up proposal](../../proposed/feature/2026-07-17-sdk-follow-up-capabilities.md); its other capabilities remain proposed.

The versioned Web welcome notice states that Session Log upload is off by default and names `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE=FEEDBACK_ONLY` and `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE=FULL` as the two opt-in choices. Its version changes with that material privacy statement so every profile acknowledges the current copy.

## Alternatives considered

**Keep opt-out defaults and improve disclosure.** Rejected because disclosure does not make a missing configuration a positive authorization to send data, especially when session telemetry can contain complete local content.

**Default session telemetry to `FEEDBACK_ONLY`.** Rejected because recording feedback would still trigger an upload without a deployment explicitly enabling outbound reporting. The default must keep both the session and its feedback local.

**Add project-level consent markers.** Rejected because `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE` already expresses consent for both feeds; another configuration entry would create conflicting settings and require launcher-specific parsing.

**Remove both telemetry implementations.** Rejected because internal deployments still need explicit `FULL` and feedback-gated reporting, and the launcher feed remains useful under `FULL`.

## Consequences

Fresh profiles and projects make no telemetry network request. Internal deployments select one mode for both feeds: `FEEDBACK_ONLY` permits only feedback-triggered Session Log sharing, while `FULL` also enables launcher reporting. The existing hard opt-out remains effective, and uploading modes retain their endpoint validation, redaction responsibility, batching, and shutdown behavior.
