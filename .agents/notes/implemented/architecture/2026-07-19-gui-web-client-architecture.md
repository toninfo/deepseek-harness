# Agent Note: Web client architecture — the client cordis plugin tree, the slot system, and the React-free object layer

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.zh.md)

> Division of labor: the channel-independent layering model and RPC protocol (message model / type system / contract face / client base class) are in the [layering and RPC protocol RFC](2026-07-19-gui-layering-and-rpc-protocol.md); this document = the browser side: how the client cordis tree loads, how UI plugins compose through slots and services, and how the React-free object layer feeds React through immutable snapshots.

## Problem

Two forces shape the browser client. First, streaming: in an event-driven conversation UI, if business state (the event window, streaming accumulation, pending interactions, the connection state machine) scatters across React components and a global store, every token chunk shakes the render tree, and swapping the UI library means rewriting the business logic. Second, modularity: UI features (layout, sidebar, conversation, theme, locale) must be independently loadable plugins — composed at runtime from a host-served manifest, not compiled into one bundle — without giving up compile-time type safety across plugin boundaries.

## Decision

Both ends run cordis. The host is a cordis plugin tree; the browser runs a second, client-side cordis tree whose every UI capability is a plugin loaded dynamically by a shell-held loader. Inside that tree, cordis ctx hosts all runtime facts (services, stores, session scopes) and React is pure projection: components import nothing from the framework, receive everything through props, and subscribe to immutable snapshots via `useSyncExternalStore` (uSES below).

## The client cordis tree and the loading chain

The loading chain — the two package kinds (plain vs dshClient plugin), the module-system/plugin-governor split, the two-phase boot over the host-authored entry graph with revisions, and hot reload — is owned by the [client plugin loading RFC](2026-07-23-client-plugin-loading-model.md). The load-bearing facts for this document: the browser boots the same vendored `@cordisjs/plugin-loader` as the host with a client module system (`ctx.modules`, `packages/client/modules`) filling its `internal` seam; every unit with product behavior is an entry in the host-authored `__DSH_BOOT__` graph — every production plugin package (infrastructure included) carries the `dshClient` declaration and arrives as a fetched `./client` tsdown closure bundle, `immediately` rows differing only in boot phase-one prefetch, while plain packages (react family, cordis, the not-yet-promoted libraries) stay shell-bundled, seeded, and invisible to the graph; bundles execute `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })` and their `require` is answered from the lazy CJS module table (seed words + registered factories, materialized and memoized on first require — cross-plugin value imports are a build error, cooperation goes through cordis services); plugin CSS is inlined in the bundle and injected as `<style data-plugin="<id>">` at materialization (CSS Modules hashing + ownership tag = isolation, removal on reload); hot reload is live in dev graphs — the webserver stat-polls the bundles it serves and broadcasts `rebuilt` SSE frames, and the `client-hmr` plugin swaps one fiber per frame. The settled flip (`loader.await()` + an all-ACTIVE sweep) still switches the shell from the loading page to the real UI in one pass — settled means every entry is created and every fiber reached ACTIVE, with FAILED/PENDING fibers listed loud; there is no partial-availability mode (progressive rendering is deferred work).

Type universes stay split at the aggregate level — `tsconfig.host.json` is the host program and `tsconfig.client.json` the client program, both referenced by the solution root `tsconfig.json` — because both sides merge cordis `Context` under the same keys (`sessions`, `loader`) with different services; client packages consume the wire vocabulary through pure type subpaths (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-session/types` and kin) so no host augmentation rides into the client program.

## The slot system: how the page composes

The slot system has its own RFC — the [slot system standard](2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md) — and this document defers to it entirely. The one-paragraph summary for orientation: the shell renders only `'root'`; a plugin composes UI through a single `register` call that occupies a slot, declares+authorizes its child slots (`children` spec object), declares its store, and injects its business face; component props arrive in four auto-derived shares (`PropsRuntime<K>` / `PropsRenderSlots<S>` / `PropsStore<H>` / inject), each from its single source of truth. `SlotMap` declaration merging is the type authority and entries carry only the owner share ("whoever injects it, owns its type"); every rendered entry sits in a per-entry error boundary.

Implementation homes: registry core and the props-share types in `packages/client/ui-slots`, outlet/renderer/uSES bridge in `packages/client/web-react`.

## Services and scope addressing

A service is a plugin's only API surface toward other plugins (UI components and injection faces are not APIs; a plugin nobody calls mounts no service — ui-trajectory is the minimal-plugin exemplar: no ctx service, only view-slot registrations). The roster: `ctx.connection` (api client + stream handles), `ctx.slots` (registry wrapper emitting `slots/changed`, render entry, renderer install seam), `ctx.sessions` (list store, current-session state, scope tree), `ctx.loader`, `ctx.theme`, `ctx.i18n`, `ctx.layout` (cross-plugin view navigation), `ctx.conversation` (send/cancel/startSession). Viewing state that used to live in service stores (panel widths, selection, drafts) now lives in entry-declared stores per the [slot system standard](2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md).

There is no registration model besides slots — the former view and tool rings both dissolved into it. Conversation views are entries of the `'conversation.view'` list slot ui-conversation declares, tab metadata rides the registration options (`id`/`order`/`label`), and per-view chrome lives inside the view components themselves. A tool row is a keyed child slot each view declares for itself — today `'conversation.chat.toolview'` (keyed/session), declared by the chat entry's `children` table; the key space is runtime-open (SlotMap declares slots, never keys), which is what the tool ring's open tool-name set required. The render site dispatches per row via `entryKey: toolName` with `GenericToolCard` as the call-site `fallback`; the owner payload is the uniform `ToolRowOwnerProps` (`callId`/`toolName`/`block`/`openDetails`), and `ToolRowProps` composes it with the session standard kit for registrant components. Registrants are plain plugins with zero dedicated machinery: `ctx.slots.inject('conversation.chat.toolview', () => ctx.slots.register({ name: 'conversation.chat.toolview', key: '<tool>', inject? }, Row))`; the declaration is the load and reload dependency, independently from `ConversationService` ([decision](2026-08-05-slot-declaration-injection.md)). Interaction drafts and other row state ride the ordinary store seat. Trajectory/waterfall get same-shaped slots (names fixed by the slot-naming discipline `<domain>.<entry>.<hole>`, one shared owner type) that land with their own row render sites — RendersCheck rejects a declaration nobody renders, so the two slots cannot be declared early.

**Scope addressing** mirrors the host's agent-scope idiom: services are root singletons whose methods take no sessionId — they read the caller's scope mark (`scopeOf(ctx)`). Inside a session scope, `ctx.conversation.send('hi', 'queue')` targets that session; cross-session calls re-target by switching ctx (`ctx.sessions.scope(id)!.conversation.send(...)`); calling a scoped method from root ctx throws. Client session scopes are minted like host agent scopes (a no-op plugin fiber + a scope-key extend), built lazily on first viewing and torn down only when the session is removed and unwatched — host-session death alone does not tear a scope (it freezes into a read-only viewport).

## The data object layer (`packages/client/runtime/src/client/sessions/`)

Frames enter, snapshots exit, the projection sits between — React-free (zero React imports, grep-assertable):

```
mux/host 帧（ConnectionController 泵入，sinks 注入）
        │
        ▼
SessionManager.handleMuxEnvelope / handleHostEnvelope
        │ 带 sessionId 的帧只投已存在实例（审批/问答 requested 例外：进 pendingBuffers 缓冲）
        ▼
Session.handleMuxEnvelope ──► events 窗口（seq 连续升序）
        │                        │ 定稿事件            │ chunk
        │                        ▼                    ▼
        │                TranscriptAdapter     PartialAccumulator
        │                  （→ nodes）          （→ partial）
        ▼
Notifier 微任务合批 ──► ConversationSnapshot 缓存 ──uSES──► 组件
```

- **Session** (session.ts): lazily built, resident — once created it keeps eating frames in the background, so switching away and back renders instantly. Operations: `prompt`/`cancel` (RPC passthrough; failures land in the snapshot's `promptError`), `open` (pull the tail history page, idempotent), `loadOlder` (upward paging, reentry-guarded), `resync` (reconnect = clear the window and rerun open). Subscription: `subscribe`/`getSnapshot` (always the cached reference) — `implements ObservableSnapshot<ConversationSnapshot>`, with `useSelector = bindSnapshotSelector(this)` attached at construction, so a Session is directly a uSES source. Frame dispatch is one switch: `session/event` frames dedup by seq (the only dedup key), buffer while open is in flight, otherwise append + incremental projection; open/stitch merges the live buffer by seq and backfills once if `subscribed.lastSeq` outruns the window tail.
- **ConversationSnapshot** (conversation.ts): the immutable snapshot contract — `nodes` (the human transcript, log-ordered), `partial`, `runningCalls`, `pending`, `running`, `removed`, `openState`, `hasMore`, `promptError` and kin. **Reference discipline** (the premise of memo and uSES): the top-level object is fresh on every change; an unchanged nodes projection keeps the same array reference, while a changed flow returns a new array that reuses unchanged element references; unchanged substructures reuse the previous snapshot's references.
- **SessionManager** (manager.ts): instance cluster + frame entry + the session list. sessionId-bearing frames go only to existing instances (a mux broadcast must not instantiate every session); approval/question `requested` frames are the exception — they never land in history, so they buffer in `pendingBuffers` and replay on instantiation.
- **Notifier** (notifier.ts): two channels chosen by change source. `markDirty()` (default; frame-driven changes always) batches per microtask — N changes, one notification, one re-render; the flush rebuilds the snapshot cache before notifying. `notifyNow()` (only direct echoes of user gestures) rebuilds and notifies in the same tick — controlled inputs roll the DOM back and jump the caret if their echo defers to a microtask. Frame-driven code using notifyNow collapses batching back to per-frame renders; banned.
- **TranscriptAdapter / PartialAccumulator**: the transcript is the append-origin surface projected in log order (`isAppendSurfaceEvent` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session/surface`) plus one marker per landed compaction checkpoint — never the model surface, which shadows replaced ranges and would erase conversation the reader already saw. Node order is seq-monotonic by construction, so there is no core `seq === index` assertion to satisfy and no degradation branch. Chunks contribute no node (O(1) skip): the accumulator folds StreamChunks into `AssistantBlock[]`, a delta swapping only that block's reference, and the finalizing message discards the accumulator in the same batch (no flicker on promotion). Cost model: one chunk = one string concatenation + a dirty mark; an unsubscribed Session under a frame storm costs only the mark.
- **ConnectionController** (in `packages/client/connection`): opens the mux/host streams, pumps with for-await, reconnects with exponential backoff (500ms doubling to 10s, jitter, unlimited) behind a generation fence; sinks are injected one-way (the Controller does not know Session). Reconnect = rebuild: `onConnected` → list refresh + per-open-session resync. The object layer faces only `IApiClient`; Web carriage uses HTTP POST for the two client→server quadrants and [one WebSocket per logical stream](2026-08-04-websocket-downlink-carrier.md) for the two server→client quadrants, while the client class family remains the layering RFC's territory.

## The React face (`packages/client/web-react`)

The glue package is the whole ctx↔React boundary; components stay framework-free.

- The snapshot store engine **lives in the runtime package** (zustand vanilla with draft-based updates, `flush: 'sync'` by default with opt-in `'raf'` batching, opt-in whole-value localStorage persistence, dev-mode deep freeze — all exported from `runtime`'s `./client` main entry, no subpath): store products are bare observable sources with no hook members. Plugins reach the engine only through `defineStore` declarations per the [slot system standard](2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md). web-react composes every hook at the binding site (`bindSnapshotSelector`, per-source cached) from the one data contract React consumes: `ObservableSnapshot<T>` (`getSnapshot`/`subscribe`) — a Session object and a snapshot store both satisfy it. Business plugin packages depend on runtime and ui-slots only; web-react is shell-only glue.
- `bindSnapshotSelector(source)`: binds a source into a typed selector hook over uSES-with-selector. The four uSES contract clauses hold by construction: getSnapshot returns the cached reference; subscribe is a bind-time closure (reference-stable forever); pure CSR passes no server snapshot; equality defaults to `Object.is` with `shallowEqual` opt-in per call.
- `useInvoke(fn)`: wraps an async action into a stable trigger plus pending flag; pending rides a per-hook external store read through uSES (no setState on the render path), concurrent invocations are counted, and the invoke reference never changes.
- Equality protocol, whole chain: producers use structural sharing; consumers short-circuit with `Object.is` or `shallowEqual`; `React.memo` shallow. Deep comparison is banned everywhere.

## Directory shape

Twelve `packages/client/*` packages (ui-slots, ui-primitives, web-react, connection, runtime, ui-layout, ui-sidebar, ui-conversation, ui-trajectory, ui-theme, i18n, web) plus `apps/web` — the vite application, a thin `main` over the shell's boot export. Plugin packages keep their browser half under `src/client/`; **every build artifact lands in `lib/`** — the node half as `lib/index.js`/`lib/invariant.js`, the browser bundle as `lib/client.js` (the shared tsdown client preset emits both; there is no `dist/` directory, and `exports["./client"]` points at `./lib/client.js`). Dependency direction: `ui-slots ← web-react ← runtime ← ui-* (peers) ← web`, with ui-primitives/ui-theme/i18n as zero-dependency side paths.

A multi-domain plugin package additionally splits its client half by future package boundaries — ui-conversation is the exemplar:

```
src/client/
  contract/    the only shared face between domains (types + composed props shares)
  service.ts   cross-domain orchestration (imports contract only)
  skeleton/    domain: shell components (ConversationRoot/InputBar/EmptyState/DetailsPanel)
  chat/        domain: the chat view
  toolviews/   domain: sample tool-row registrants (third-party posture)
  apply.ts     the ONLY file allowed to import across domains (assembly point)
  index.ts     thin re-export shell (contract + apply + components)
```

Domain implementation files never import a sibling domain — shared surfaces route through `contract/` (e.g. the toolviews samples take `ToolRowProps` from the contract, never chat internals). `scripts/verify-client-domain-graph.ts` enforces the layering (contract=0, domains=1, apply/index=2; imports may only point at levels ≤ own; sibling-domain edges fail). A future package split promotes each domain directory to a package and mechanically rewrites import paths.

## How to develop

- **A new UI feature** = a new plugin package: declare `dshClient` (+ `inject` topology) in package.json, write the browser half under `src/client/` (apply mounts services/stores and registers slots), keep the node half an empty apply unless there is host logic, build with the shared preset. Add the plugin to the host config; the manifest and loading follow automatically.
- **A new slot**: see the [slot system standard RFC](2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md) — merge the contract into `SlotMap`, declare it in the parent entry's `children`, render through the auto-injected `renderSlot` prop. Never export components globally.
- **Consuming a new frame type**: sessionId-bearing → a branch in Session's dispatch switch; host-level → the Manager routing table; if the UI needs it, a `ConversationSnapshot` field with the reference discipline kept.
- **Where does this state live**: business data (events, streaming, pending) → always the object layer; what the parent knows → owner props at the renderSlot site; private to one component (scroll, search text, expansion) → component state; shared across entries or surviving remounts (selection, drafts, panel widths) → an entry-declared store ([slot system standard](2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md)).
- **Notification channel**: frame-driven/async = `markDirty` batching; direct user-gesture echo whose controlled input needs the same tick = `notifyNow`.

## Consequences

Token streams no longer shake the render tree: a frame storm costs unsubscribed sessions one dirty bit and the subscribed view one batched re-render per microtask (raf-batched for frame-driven stores). UI features load, fail, and get disabled as independent plugins — one crashing slot entry blacks out one card, one failed bundle fails loud before the UI flips in. The accepted costs: the loader/module-table machinery is bespoke infrastructure the team owns end to end; the one-flip boot (no progressive rendering) trades first-paint granularity for assembly simplicity; and the dual type programs make "which aggregate sees this file" a question developers occasionally have to answer.

## Alternatives considered

| Rejected | One-line reason |
|---|---|
| One statically-linked SPA bundle | Plugins must be host-composable at runtime (config-driven); a monolith re-couples every UI feature to one build |
| window globals / import maps for shared deps | The DI require table keeps sharing explicit, fail-loud, and swappable; globals leak identity and version silently |
| Business data in zustand slices | The event window/accumulator is a behavioral state machine, not a flat slice; the object layer keeps snapshot granularity and batching controllable |
| String-keyed global component registry for tool rows | Per-view keyed child slots plus in-component session branching carry the same need with the one registration model; a parallel registry does not come back ([toolview dissolution](2026-07-23-toolview-dissolution.md)) |
| Progressive/Suspense boot in P-I | One-flip boot is strictly simpler; the loader's per-plugin status face is kept so progressive lighting can land later without re-architecture |
