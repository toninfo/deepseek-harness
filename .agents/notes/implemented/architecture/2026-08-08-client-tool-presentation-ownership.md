# Agent Note: Client Tool presentation ownership

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-08-08-client-tool-presentation-ownership.zh.md)

## Problem

The Client Runtime already projects Tool calls into a stable lifecycle: it pairs call/result events by `callId`, preserves running and settled forms, and indexes Code Dispatch children by their root call. The chat view nevertheless owned the entire presentation stack. It placed root calls in ChatFlow, composed each root with its subcalls, dispatched every atomic call by Tool name, carried the generic fallback and card models, registered first-party Tool views, and reused those models in the details panel.

That ownership made `ui-conversation` interpret business Tool names and made subcalls an orphaned concern if an atomic Tool view moved elsewhere. A business package such as `ui-skill` could register a row, but it still depended on conversation's Tool-specific composition contract. Adding Tool-specific Session projection would duplicate a data model the Runtime already owns, while moving only individual React components would leave the composition and model coupling in place.

## Decision

Tool is a first-class Client UI concept with one presentation owner, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-tool`. Session Event, projection, fold, `ConversationSnapshot` construction and caching, historical paging, and Code Dispatch indexing remain unchanged.

“First-class concept” describes UI ownership only; it adds no Runtime data kind. `ConversationNode` remains the transcript projection, `ChatFlowItem` remains the render unit produced when conversation sorts and groups nodes, `ToolCallBlock` remains the standard data for one call, and `ToolCallTree` only composes root/subcall presentation within Tool. Command continues to render through the separate `'conversation.chat.commandview'` seat and does not become Tool.

`ui-conversation` owns ordered placement. `deriveChatFlow()` still decides where a settled Tool group appears, and `ChatView` still appends running calls, maintains scroll anchors and selection, and supplies host actions. For each root call it renders the single/session `'conversation.chat.tool'` seat with the root block, selected call id, session cwd, and open-file/inspect callbacks. It does not read Code Dispatch children, branch on Tool names, or import Tool-specific views and card models.

`ui-tool` occupies that whole-Tool seat. Through its standard session slot props, `ToolCallTree` selects the Runtime-projected `codeDispatches[rootCallId]` array, renders the root followed by that one currently supported child level, and routes both forms through one keyed/session `'tool.call.toolview'` child slot using `entryKey: toolName`. An absent business registration renders `GenericToolCard`. This is deliberately one-level composition, not a claim that the Runtime supports an arbitrary recursive call graph.

Business plugins register only atomic views against `'tool.call.toolview'`. Their owner payload is the standard Tool call block plus identity, cwd, and host actions; it carries no Session projector or conversation service. Skill remains an ordinary Tool and `ui-skill` registers the `skill` key through this seam. Existing first-party views live in `ui-tool` until a business package has a reason to own one independently.

The details panel is a second Tool presentation site but not a call-tree owner. `ui-conversation` delegates its selected output body through the single/session `'conversation.details.tool'` seat; `ui-tool` renders the card-aware output and the seat fallback preserves raw result text when the plugin is absent. Card models therefore have one production owner without introducing a reverse implementation import.

The Runtime remains the authority for Tool lifecycle and call topology. Code Dispatch stays a top-level official concept because it changes `codeDispatches` and parent/child identity; ordinary Tool business differences stay at the keyed presentation seam. This package boundary does not add a Tool projector/fold registry.

## Runtime and render path

This boundary starts at the Client's `ConversationSnapshot`; the full render path is:

```text
ConversationSnapshot.nodes
  -> deriveChatFlow()
  -> settled tool-group positions ----+
                                      |
ConversationSnapshot.runningCalls     |
  -> ChatView flow tail ---------------+-> ToolSeat
                                           -> conversation.chat.tool
                                           -> ToolCallTree
ConversationSnapshot.codeDispatches[rootCallId] -+
                                                  +-> root ToolCall + one-level child ToolCall
                                                      -> tool.call.toolview(entryKey = toolName)
                                                           |- registered atomic view
                                                           `- GenericToolCard fallback
```

The live Session's [`Session.buildSnapshot()`](../../../../packages/client/runtime/src/client/sessions/session.ts) caches arrays or maps such as `nodes`, `runningCalls`, and `codeDispatches` against independent revisions. Their references stay stable when the corresponding business state has not changed, allowing React selectors and memoization to skip unrelated updates. The historical projection's [`projectConversationHistory()`](../../../../packages/client/runtime/src/client/session-history/history-fold.ts) reconstructs the same running-call and Code Dispatch shapes from entries in its window. Tool UI consumes the snapshot shapes already unified by those paths; presentation packages do not repeat call/result pairing, historical replay, or cache indexing.

[`ChatView`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/chat/ChatView.tsx) reruns [`deriveChatFlow()`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/chat/chat-flow.ts) only when the `nodes` reference changes. It groups consecutive settled Tool results into a `tool-group`, while running root calls append at the flow tail. Both paths ultimately enter the same `ToolSeat`, so settled and running forms share the whole-Tool seat. `ToolCallTree` selects only the current root's `codeDispatches[rootCallId]`; it does not introduce a business projector for presentation of other roots.

## Code and responsibility boundaries

| Owner | Primary code | Owns | Explicitly does not own |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client Runtime | [`Session`](../../../../packages/client/runtime/src/client/sessions/session.ts), [`history-fold.ts`](../../../../packages/client/runtime/src/client/session-history/history-fold.ts) | call/result pairing, running/settled lifecycle, Code Dispatch parent/child index, snapshot reference stability | Business views selected by Tool name |
| `ui-conversation` | [`chat-flow.ts`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/chat/chat-flow.ts), [`ChatView.tsx`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/chat/ChatView.tsx), [`slots.ts`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/contract/slots.ts) | ChatFlow order, settled groups, running tail, scroll anchors, selection and host actions, whole-Tool seat declaration | subcall composition, `toolName` dispatch, Generic fallback, Tool card models |
| `ui-tool` | [`apply.ts`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/apply.ts), [`ToolCallTree.tsx`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/tool/ToolCallTree.tsx), [`slots.ts`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/contract/slots.ts) | root/subcall composition, atomic keyed dispatch, Generic fallback, Tool card models and built-in Tool views | ChatFlow ordering, Session Event fold |
| Business Tool plugins | [`ui-skill` registration example](../../../../packages/client/ui-skill/src/client/index.ts) | Atomic views for one or more wire Tool names | root/subcall placement and lifecycle pairing |
| Details path | [`DetailsPanel.tsx`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/skeleton/DetailsPanel.tsx), [`ToolDetails.tsx`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/tool/ToolDetails.tsx) | selected-call lookup, card-aware output, and raw fallback | chat call-tree composition |

## Slot and owner contract

A slot declaration also constrains render ownership. The conversation chat entry declares `'conversation.chat.tool'` through `children`, so only `ChatView` places the whole-Tool seat. When `ui-tool` registers that seat, its `children` declares `'tool.call.toolview'`, so only `ToolCallTree` renders the atomic Tool seat. Business plugins register keyed entries only; they neither participate in root/subcall composition nor establish a registry parallel to slots.

The whole seat's `ToolTreeOwnerProps` carries the root `callId`, `toolName`, `ToolCallBlock`, `selectedCallId`, session `cwd`, `openFile(path)`, and `inspectCall(callId)`. `ToolCallTree` converts either a root or child into the same `ToolCallOwnerProps` and narrows inspect to a callback for that call. The atomic owner carries no `ReactNode`, Cordis `Context`, Session service, or projector; a business view consumes only one standard call block and host actions.

Business plugins use one registration shape:

```text
ctx.slots.inject('tool.call.toolview', () =>
  ctx.slots.register({
    name: 'tool.call.toolview',
    key: '<wire tool name>',
  }, BusinessToolRow))
```

`ui-tool`'s [`apply()`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/apply.ts) registers the whole-Tool renderer, details renderer, and existing built-in atomic views. An existing independent business package can move only its keyed registration, as `ui-skill` does, without changing `ui-conversation` or Session.

## Details path

[`DetailsPanel`](../../../../packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/skeleton/DetailsPanel.tsx) still locates the selected call in `nodes`, `runningCalls`, and `codeDispatches`, and it owns input arguments, empty states, and panel lifecycle. It passes only `{ block, cwd }` to `'conversation.details.tool'`; [`ToolDetails`](../../../../packages/client/ui-tool/src/client/tool/ToolDetails.tsx) reuses Tool card models to render the output. When `ui-tool` is absent, a settled call falls back to raw result text and a running call shows conversation's running fallback, so details never imports the Tool implementation in reverse.

## Verification

Test ownership follows production ownership. `ui-conversation` tests install a local whole-Tool seat probe and assert only ChatFlow placement, owner payload, and host contracts such as selection, open-file, and inspect; they do not import `ui-tool` production code or test helpers. `ui-tool` tests mount a real conversation host and verify root/subcall composition, keyed dispatch, generic fallback, concrete Tool UI, and plugin lifecycle.

## Alternatives considered

**Keep atomic Tool slots under every conversation view.** Rejected: each view would have to reproduce root/subcall composition, and a Tool registration would be isolated by view even though its business meaning is Tool-wide. A whole-Tool seat preserves view-owned placement while giving the call tree one owner. This supersedes the per-view placement selected by the earlier [toolview dissolution](2026-07-23-toolview-dissolution.md), while retaining its keyed-slot and no-parallel-registry decisions.

**Move only the Tool React components and card models.** Rejected: `ChatView` would still own Tool-name dispatch and Code Dispatch composition, so the dependency would change file paths without changing responsibility.

**Add business-specific Session projectors or folds.** Rejected: ordinary Tool views consume the standard call block already reconstructed by Runtime. A second registry would create two authorities for call identity and historical replay. Only a feature that changes logged topology or lifecycle earns a Runtime-level extension.

**Make each atomic Tool view render its own subcalls recursively.** Rejected: the atomic registrant receives one Tool call and should not know whether it is a root or child. Root/child composition belongs to `ui-tool`, and the current wire/runtime shape only supports one Code Dispatch child level.

**Import `ui-tool` components directly from `ui-conversation`.** Rejected: it would reverse the intended feature direction and make Tool presentation mandatory. Declared slots retain lifecycle ownership, fallback behavior, and independent plugin loading.

## Consequences

`ui-conversation` becomes independent of Tool-name business presentation while retaining ChatFlow, selection, and host interaction responsibilities. Root calls and subcalls cannot drift onto different dispatch paths, and business packages can own atomic Tool presentation without Session changes. The cost is one new Client package and two cross-package slot seams; `ui-tool` also deliberately depends on conversation's declared seats and locale namespace. The assembled Web bundle therefore mounts `ui-tool`; omitting it leaves chat Tool seats empty while the details seat keeps its raw-result fallback, without changing Session reconstruction.
